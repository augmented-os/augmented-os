# Deep Research Projects

This directory contains completed and ongoing deep research projects conducted using our standardized 5-step process. Each project explores a complex technical question relevant to the Augmented OS platform.

## Active Research Projects

| Research Topic | Description | Status | Last Updated |
|----|----|----|----|
| [Orchestration](./orchestration/) | Evaluation of workflow orchestration approaches for Augmented OS | Completed | \[Date\] |

## Creating New Research Projects

To create a new research project:


1. Create a new directory with a descriptive name (e.g., `data-storage-strategy/`)
2. Include the 5 standard files following the process:
   * `1-prompt.md` - Initial research question and context
   * `2-clarify.md` - Clarification of requirements and constraints
   * `3-research.md` - In-depth exploration of the topic
   * `4-findings.md` - Summary of key insights and recommendations
   * `5-action.md` - Implementation plan and next steps
3. Add a `README.md` that provides an overview of the research project
4. Update this README to include your new research project

## Project Structure

Each research project should follow this structure:

```
project-name/
├── README.md        # Project overview
├── 1-prompt.md      # Initial research question
├── 2-clarify.md     # Clarification exchanges
├── 3-research.md    # In-depth research
├── 4-findings.md    # Summary of findings
└── 5-action.md      # Implementation plan
```

## Research Project Lifecycle


1. **Initiation**: Create the project directory and draft the initial prompt
2. **Refinement**: Conduct clarification exchanges to refine the scope
3. **Investigation**: Perform in-depth research on the topic
4. **Synthesis**: Summarize findings and develop recommendations
5. **Planning**: Define concrete action steps for implementation
6. **Review**: Conduct peer review of the research findings
7. **Implementation**: Execute the action plan
8. **Retrospective**: Document lessons learned and update research as needed
