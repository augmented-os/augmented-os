# Deep Research Process

This directory contains documentation of our standardized 5-step process for conducting deep technical research. Each step has specific guidelines to ensure consistent, high-quality research outcomes.

## The 5-Step Process

1. [**Prompt**](./1-prompt.md) - Craft the initial research question and context
   * Define the problem space clearly
   * Provide relevant background information
   * Specify the desired outcome and technical depth
2. [**Clarify**](./2-clarify.md) - Refine the scope through clarifying questions
   * Address ambiguities in the initial prompt
   * Establish constraints and requirements
   * Define success criteria
3. [**Research**](./3-research.md) - Conduct in-depth technical exploration
   * Investigate multiple approaches and technologies
   * Evaluate trade-offs and considerations
   * Provide evidence and references
4. [**Findings**](./4-findings.md) - Summarize key insights and recommendations
   * Present clear, actionable findings
   * Support recommendations with evidence
   * Acknowledge limitations and trade-offs
5. [**Action**](./5-action.md) - Define concrete implementation steps
   * Outline specific next steps
   * Assign ownership and timelines
   * Identify success metrics and risk mitigation strategies

## When to Use Deep Research

Deep research is most valuable when:

1. Exploring complex technical domains with many variables
2. Evaluating architectural or design alternatives
3. Investigating performance or scalability challenges
4. Assessing emerging technologies or approaches
5. Solving particularly difficult technical problems

## Best Practices

* Keep each document focused on its specific step in the process
* Include specific examples and evidence in the research phase
* Ensure findings are actionable and clearly connected to the research
* Define concrete next steps in the action plan
* Document the actual process followed, including challenges and iterations
