# Deep Research

This directory contains documentation of our deep research process and the research projects conducted using this methodology.

## Overview

Deep research is our structured approach to exploring complex technical questions that require thorough investigation before making architectural or implementation decisions. Each research project follows our standardized 5-step process:

1. **Prompt** - Craft the initial research question and context
2. **Clarify** - Refine the scope through clarifying questions
3. **Research** - Conduct in-depth technical exploration
4. **Findings** - Summarize key insights and recommendations
5. **Action** - Define concrete implementation steps

## Directory Structure

- [Process](./process/) - Documentation of our research methodology
- [Projects](./projects/) - Completed and ongoing research projects

## Getting Started

To initiate a new research project:

1. Review the [process documentation](./process/) to understand the methodology
2. Create a new project directory in the [projects](./projects/) folder
3. Follow the 5-step process, creating the corresponding documents
4. Update the projects README.md to include your new research project

## Benefits of Our Approach

- **Structured Process**: Consistent methodology ensures thorough exploration
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Research findings are documented for future reference
- **Actionable Outcomes**: Each project concludes with concrete next steps
- **Collaborative**: The process supports input from multiple stakeholders
- **Transparent**: Research assumptions and trade-offs are explicitly documented

## Research Documentation

When documenting deep research, include:

1. **Research Question**: Clear statement of what you're trying to learn
2. **Process Steps**: Document each step of the 5-step process
3. **Key Findings**: Highlight the most important discoveries
4. **Supporting Evidence**: Include relevant data, code, or outputs
5. **Next Actions**: Specific follow-up tasks based on the research
