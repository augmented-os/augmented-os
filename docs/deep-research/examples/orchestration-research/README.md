# Orchestration Research

## Overview

This research project explores orchestration approaches for the Augmented OS platform, evaluating different architectural patterns and technologies for workflow orchestration.

## Research Context

Augmented OS requires a robust orchestration layer to manage complex workflows across multiple services and components. This research aims to identify the most appropriate orchestration approach that meets our scalability, reliability, and flexibility requirements.

## Research Process

This project follows our standard 5-step deep research process:

1. [Prompt](./1-prompt.md) - Initial research question and context
2. [Clarify](./2-clarify.md) - Clarification of requirements and constraints
3. [Research](./3-research.md) - In-depth exploration of orchestration approaches
4. [Findings](./4-findings.md) - Summary of key insights and recommendations
5. [Action](./5-action.md) - Implementation plan and next steps

## Key Questions Addressed

- What orchestration patterns are most suitable for our microservices architecture?
- How do different orchestration technologies compare in terms of scalability and reliability?
- What are the trade-offs between centralized and choreographed orchestration approaches?
- How should we handle long-running workflows and state management?
- What monitoring and observability considerations are important for orchestration?
