# Research Phase: Workflow Orchestration Architecture

*Note: This file should be replaced with the actual content from architecture-analysis.md*

## Overview

This document contains the in-depth research on workflow orchestration approaches for Augmented OS. It explores different architectural patterns, evaluates specific technologies, and analyzes their suitability for our requirements.

## Research Areas

The research covers:

1. **Orchestration Patterns**
   - Centralized orchestration
   - Choreography
   - Hybrid approaches
   - Saga pattern

2. **Technology Evaluation**
   - Temporal
   - Camunda
   - AWS Step Functions
   - Netflix Conductor
   - Custom solutions

3. **Implementation Considerations**
   - State management
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Versioning and migration
   - Monitoring and observability
   - Performance and scalability

4. **Case Studies**
   - Similar systems and their architectural choices
   - Lessons learned from industry implementations

## Research Methodology

The research involved:
- Literature review of orchestration patterns
- Technical evaluation of specific technologies
- Analysis of case studies and industry practices
- Consideration of our specific requirements and constraints
