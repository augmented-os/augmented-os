# Action Plan: Workflow Orchestration Architecture

## Summary of Findings

Our research concluded that Temporal is the most appropriate workflow orchestration platform for Augmented OS, offering the best combination of reliability, scalability, and developer experience. We recommend implementing a hybrid architecture that combines Temporal for workflow orchestration with our existing event infrastructure for service-to-service communication.

## Implementation Actions

1. **Establish Temporal Infrastructure** (Weeks 1-3)
   - Owner: DevOps Team
   - Set up development Temporal cluster
   - Define infrastructure-as-code for production deployment
   - Establish monitoring and alerting
   - Document operational procedures

2. **Develop Core Patterns and Libraries** (Weeks 2-4)
   - Owner: Platform Team
   - Create base workflow patterns and utilities
   - Develop integration with authentication system
   - Establish error handling patterns
   - Create testing utilities and frameworks

3. **Pilot Implementation** (Weeks 4-6)
   - Owner: Product Team A
   - Identify a suitable non-critical workflow for pilot
   - Implement the workflow using Temporal
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Validate functionality and performance

4. **Team Training** (Weeks 3-5)
   - Owner: Engineering Managers
   - Organize Temporal training sessions
   - Develop internal documentation and examples
   - Create workflow development guidelines
   - Establish code review criteria for workflows

5. **Production Deployment** (Weeks 7-8)
   - Owner: DevOps and Platform Teams
   - Deploy Temporal to production environment
   - Migrate pilot workflow to production
   - Establish monitoring and support processes
   - Document lessons learned

6. **Expand Implementation** (Weeks 9-12)
   - Owner: Product Teams
   - Identify next set of workflows for implementation
   - Develop implementation plan for each workflow
   - Establish timeline for migration of existing workflows
   - Create feedback mechanism for continuous improvement

## Further Research Needed

1. **Multi-region Deployment Strategy**
   - Research Question: What is the optimal approach for deploying Temporal across multiple regions?
   - Approach: Evaluate Temporal's multi-cluster capabilities, conduct experiments with different topologies
   - Owner: DevOps Team
   - Timeline: 2 weeks

2. **Workflow Versioning Patterns**
   - Research Question: What patterns should we establish for versioning workflows and handling in-flight migrations?
   - Approach: Review Temporal documentation, experiment with different approaches, consult with Temporal community
   - Owner: Platform Team
   - Timeline: 2 weeks

## Knowledge Sharing

1. **Architecture Decision Record**
   - Create ADR documenting the decision to use Temporal
   - Include rationale, alternatives considered, and implementation approach
   - Owner: Lead Architect
   - Timeline: 1 week

2. **Technical Overview Presentation**
   - Prepare presentation on Temporal architecture and our implementation approach
   - Present to engineering team
   - Owner: Platform Team Lead
   - Timeline: Schedule for next engineering all-hands

3. **Developer Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive documentation on workflow development patterns
   - Include examples, best practices, and troubleshooting guides
   - Owner: Platform Team
   - Timeline: Initial version by week 4, iterate based on feedback

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Risk: Operational Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Dedicated training for DevOps team
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
   - Mitigation: Clear operational runbooks
   - Contingency: Identify managed Temporal service options as backup

2. **Risk: Learning Curve Impact on Delivery**
   - Mitigation: Phased approach starting with non-critical workflows
   - Mitigation: Dedicated training and documentation
   - Mitigation: Platform team support for initial implementations
   - Contingency: Maintain ability to implement workflows using existing patterns if needed

3. **Risk: Integration Challenges**
   - Mitigation: Early proof-of-concept for key integration points
   - Mitigation: Clear patterns for service integration
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing strategy
   - Contingency: Identify fallback approaches for challenging integration scenarios

## Success Metrics

1. **Developer Productivity**
   - Measure time to implement new workflows compared to previous approaches
   - Target: 30% reduction in development time for complex workflows

2. **Reliability**
   - Track workflow failure rates and recovery effectiveness
   - Target: 99.9% successful workflow completion rate

3. **Operational Overhead**
   - Monitor time spent on operational issues
   - Target: Less than 5% of DevOps time dedicated to Temporal maintenance

4. **Adoption**
   - Track percentage of new workflows implemented using Temporal
   - Target: 80% of new workflows using Temporal within 6 months
