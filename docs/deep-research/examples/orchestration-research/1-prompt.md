# Research Topic: Workflow Orchestration Architecture for Augmented OS

## Background
Augmented OS needs a robust workflow orchestration system to manage complex business processes across multiple services. We need to evaluate different architectural approaches to ensure scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

## Research Question
What is the most appropriate workflow orchestration architecture for Augmented OS considering our requirements for handling complex workflows, supporting long-running processes, ensuring reliability, and maintaining scalability?

## Relevant Information
- Our system needs to support both short-lived and long-running workflows (potentially lasting days or weeks)
- We have a microservices architecture with services written primarily in Node.js and Python
- We anticipate needing to handle thousands of concurrent workflow instances
- Workflows need to be versioned and support in-flight migration when possible
- We need to support both synchronous and asynchronous task execution
- Error handling and recovery are critical requirements
- We're currently considering several approaches: 
  - Centralized orchestration (e.g., Temporal, Camunda)
  - Choreography with event-driven architecture
  - Hybrid approaches
  - Custom implementation

## Desired Outcome
A comprehensive analysis of orchestration approaches with specific recommendations for Augmented OS, including architectural patterns, technology choices, and implementation considerations.

## Technical Depth
Detailed technical analysis including architectural patterns, technology evaluations, scalability considerations, state management approaches, and specific implementation guidance.
