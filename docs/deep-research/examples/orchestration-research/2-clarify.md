# Clarification Phase: Workflow Orchestration Architecture

This document captures the clarification exchanges that helped refine the scope and requirements for the orchestration research.

## Clarification Exchange 1: Workflow Complexity

**Question**: Can you provide examples of the types of workflows you need to support and their complexity?

**Response**: Our workflows range from simple linear processes to complex workflows with:
- Parallel execution branches
- Dynamic decision points based on data
- Human approval steps with timeouts
- Conditional retry logic
- Sub-workflows that can be reused
- Cross-service transactions

A typical complex workflow might be an order fulfillment process that involves inventory checks, payment processing, shipping coordination, and customer notifications, with various error handling paths and timeout-based escalations.

## Clarification Exchange 2: Performance Requirements

**Question**: What are your specific performance requirements for workflow execution?

**Response**: For most workflows, we need:
- Workflow initiation response time under 200ms
- Task transition time under 100ms
- Support for at least 100 workflow initiations per second at peak
- Ability to handle at least 10,000 active workflow instances
- Minimal performance degradation as workflow history grows

For long-running workflows, we prioritize reliability and consistency over raw performance.

## Clarification Exchange 3: Deployment Environment

**Question**: What is your deployment environment and are there any constraints we should consider?

**Response**: We deploy on Kubernetes in AWS. Key considerations:
- Multi-region deployment for disaster recovery
- Ability to scale components independently
- Support for blue/green deployments
- Integration with our existing monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Compatibility with our CI/CD pipeline
- Reasonable resource requirements (we're cost-conscious but will invest where needed)

## Clarification Exchange 4: Team Experience

**Question**: What is your team's experience with different orchestration technologies?

**Response**: Our team has:
- Strong experience with event-driven architectures and Kafka
- Some experience with AWS Step Functions
- Limited experience with Temporal or Camunda
- Strong Node.js and Python skills
- Experience building distributed systems

We're willing to invest in learning new technologies if they're the right fit, but would prefer solutions that align with our existing skills when possible.

## Clarification Exchange 5: Integration Requirements

**Question**: How does the orchestration system need to integrate with other systems?

**Response**: The orchestration system needs to:
- Integrate with our existing event bus (Kafka)
- Support calling RESTful and gRPC services
- Provide webhooks for external system callbacks
- Expose APIs for status queries and manual interventions
- Support our authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Provide detailed audit logs for compliance
- Allow integration with our existing monitoring and alerting

## Summary of Key Requirements

Based on the clarification phase, these are the key requirements for our orchestration architecture:

1. **Workflow Complexity**: Support for complex, multi-step workflows with parallel execution, conditional logic, and human interaction
2. **Reliability**: Strong guarantees for workflow execution, even during system failures
3. **Scalability**: Ability to handle thousands of concurrent workflows with consistent performance
4. **Long-running Processes**: Support for workflows that may run for days or weeks
5. **Versioning**: Ability to update workflow definitions without disrupting in-flight instances
6. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and debugging capabilities
7. **Developer Experience**: Good tooling and reasonable learning curve for our team
8. **Operational Simplicity**: Manageable operational overhead and deployment complexity
