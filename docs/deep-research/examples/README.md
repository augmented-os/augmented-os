# Deep Research Examples

This directory contains examples of deep research projects conducted using the 5-step process:

1. **Prompt** - Craft the initial research prompt
2. **Clarify** - Respond to clarifying questions
3. **Research** - Perform the deep research
4. **Findings** - Summarize key findings
5. **Action** - Define follow-up actions

## Available Research Examples

| Research Topic | Description | Date Completed |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| [Orchestration Research](./orchestration-research/README.md) | Evaluation of workflow orchestration approaches for Augmented OS | [Date] |

## Creating New Research Projects

To create a new research project:

1. Create a new directory with a descriptive name
2. Include the 5 standard files following the process:
   - `1-prompt.md` - Initial research question and context
   - `2-clarify.md` - Clarification of requirements and constraints
   - `3-research.md` - In-depth exploration of the topic
   - `4-findings.md` - Summary of key insights and recommendations
   - `5-action.md` - Implementation plan and next steps
3. Add a `README.md` that provides an overview of the research project
4. Update this README to include your new research project

## Best Practices

- Keep each document focused on its specific step in the process
- Include specific examples and evidence in the research phase
- Ensure findings are actionable and clearly connected to the research
- Define concrete next steps in the action plan
- Document the actual process followed, including challenges and iterations
