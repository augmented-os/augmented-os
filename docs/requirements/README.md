# Requirements Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive requirements documentation that bridges the gap between architecture documentation and roadmap planning. The requirements documentation defines what we're building from a user's perspective, providing clear requirements and expectations for the roadmap planning and engineering phases.

## Structure

The requirements documentation is organized into the following key sections:

* **[Vision](./vision/)**: High-level system vision, personas, and goals
  * [Overview](./vision/overview/): System purpose and high-level vision
  * [Personas](./vision/personas/): User personas and their needs
  * [Goals](./vision/goals/): System goals and success metrics
* **[User Journeys](./user_journeys/)**: End-to-end user experiences and workflows
  * [Workflow Management](./user_journeys/workflow_management/): User journeys for managing workflows
  * [Task Execution](./user_journeys/task_execution/): User journeys for executing tasks
  * [Integration Management](./user_journeys/integration_management/): User journeys for managing integrations
  * [Analytics](./user_journeys/analytics/): User journeys for analytics and reporting
* **[Features](./features/)**: Detailed feature specifications
  * [Workflow Designer](./features/workflow_designer/): Workflow designer feature specifications
  * [Task Management](./features/task_management/): Task management feature specifications
  * [Integration Hub](./features/integration_hub/): Integration hub feature specifications
  * [Dashboards](./features/dashboards/): Dashboard feature specifications
* **[UI/UX](./ui_ux/)**: User interface and experience specifications
  * [Wireframes](./ui_ux/wireframes/): Low-fidelity UI wireframes
  * [Mockups](./ui_ux/mockups/): High-fidelity UI mockups
  * [Prototypes](./ui_ux/prototypes/): Interactive prototypes
  * [Design System](./ui_ux/design_system/): UI design system specifications
* **[Cross-Cutting](./cross_cutting/)**: Requirements that span across features
  * [Performance](./cross_cutting/performance/): Performance requirements
  * [Security](./cross_cutting/security/): Security requirements
  * [Compliance](./cross_cutting/compliance/): Compliance requirements

## How to Use This Documentation


1. Start with the [Vision](./vision/) documentation to understand the high-level system purpose and goals
2. Explore the [User Journeys](./user_journeys/) to understand the end-to-end user experiences
3. Dive into [Features](./features/) for detailed feature specifications
4. Refer to [UI/UX](./ui_ux/) for user interface and experience specifications
5. Review [Cross-Cutting](./cross_cutting/) requirements for performance, security, and compliance considerations
