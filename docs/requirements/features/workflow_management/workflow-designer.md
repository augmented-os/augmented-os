# Feature Specification: Workflow Canvas

## Overview

The Workflow Canvas is the core UI component that allows users to visually design, edit, and review workflow definitions. It provides a drag-and-drop interface for creating workflow nodes, connecting them with edges, and configuring their properties, enabling users to create complex workflow definitions without writing code.

## User Stories

* As a workflow designer, I want to drag and drop nodes onto a canvas so that I can visually build my workflow.
* As a workflow designer, I want to connect nodes with edges so that I can define the flow of execution.
* As a workflow designer, I want to edit node properties via a properties panel so that I can configure how each step works.
* As a workflow designer, I want to validate my workflow before saving so that I can identify and fix issues early.
* As a workflow designer, I want to group related nodes together so that I can organize complex workflows.
* As a workflow designer, I want to zoom and pan around the canvas so that I can work with large workflows.

## Target Users

This feature is primarily for:

* [Workflow Designer](../../vision/personas/workflow_designer.md)
* [System Integrator](../../vision/personas/system_integrator.md)

## Feature Requirements

### Must Have

* Drag-and-drop interface for adding nodes to the canvas

* Undo/redo functionality for all canvas operations
* Zoom in/out and panning capabilities

### Should Have

* Node grouping functionality to organize related nodes
* Minimap for navigating large workflows
* Auto-layout functionality to organize nodes

### Won't Have (Out of Scope)

* Real-time workflow execution directly from the canvas
* 3D visualization of workflows
* Code generation beyond workflow definition JSON
* Integration with external version control systems
* Support for custom node implementations via in-canvas code editing

## User Interface Requirements

The UI for this feature should:

* Present a clear canvas area with a grid background for alignment
* Provide a palette of available node types that can be dragged onto the canvas
* Show a properties panel that updates based on the selected node
* Include a toolbar with common operations (save, load, undo, redo, etc.)
* Display validation errors and warnings directly on the canvas
* Remain responsive and performant with workflows up to 100 nodes

See the related [Workflow Canvas UI/UX Documentation](../../ui_ux/wireframes/workflow_canvas.md) for detailed wireframes and mockups.

## Functional Behavior

### Core Behavior

The Workflow Canvas operates on a graph data model where nodes represent workflow tasks and edges represent execution flow. The canvas allows users to manipulate this graph visually:


1. Users can add nodes by dragging them from a palette onto the canvas
2. Users can connect nodes by creating edges from one node's output port to another node's input port
3. Users can configure nodes by selecting them and editing properties in a panel
4. Users can reposition nodes by dragging them around the canvas
5. Users can select multiple nodes using click+drag or Ctrl+click
6. The canvas validates the workflow structure and highlights issues

### States and Transitions

The canvas can exist in the following states:


1. **Empty State**: No nodes present, showing guidance to get started
2. **Editing State**: Active editing of workflow in progress
3. **Selection State**: One or more nodes selected, showing properties
4. **Edge Creation State**: User in process of creating an edge
5. **Validation Error State**: Workflow has validation errors that must be fixed
6. **Read-Only State**: Canvas is in view-only mode

### Algorithms and Logic

* **Layout Algorithm**: Force-directed graph layout with customizable parameters
* **Validation Logic**: Graph traversal to detect cycles, unreachable nodes, and configuration errors
* **Undo/Redo Stack**: Command pattern implementation for operation history
* **Selection Logic**: Rectangle and individual selection with standard modifier keys
* **Serialization Logic**: JSON schema-based serialization of workflow graph

## Data Requirements

### Data Model

The canvas operates on the following data model:

```json
{
  "id": "workflow-123",
  "name": "Example Workflow",
  "description": "A workflow that processes data",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "node-1",
      "type": "start",
      "position": { "x": 100, "y": 100 },
      "properties": {}
    },
    {
      "id": "node-2",
      "type": "process",
      "position": { "x": 300, "y": 100 },
      "properties": {
        "operation": "transform",
        "parameters": {}
      }
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "id": "edge-1",
      "source": "node-1",
      "sourcePort": "output",
      "target": "node-2",
      "targetPort": "input"
    }
  ],
  "groups": [
    {
      "id": "group-1",
      "name": "Processing Group",
      "nodes": ["node-1", "node-2"]
    }
  ]
}
```

For the complete schema definition and additional details, refer to the [Workflow Definitions Schema Documentation](../../../architecture/components/workflow_orchestrator_service/schemas/workflow_definitions.md).

### Data Storage

Workflow definitions will be stored in the workflow_definition table in the database, with the following structure:

* id (UUID): Unique identifier for the workflow
* name (String): Human-readable name of the workflow
* description (String): Optional description of the workflow
* definition (JSONB): The complete workflow definition in JSON format
* version (Integer): The version number of this workflow definition
* created_at (Timestamp): When the workflow was created
* updated_at (Timestamp): When the workflow was last updated
* created_by (UUID): User who created the workflow
* status (Enum): Draft, Published, Deprecated

### Data Inputs and Outputs

* **Input**: Workflow definition JSON loaded from the database or imported
* **Output**: Updated workflow definition JSON saved to the database or exported

## Integration Requirements

This feature integrates with:

* **Workflow Orchestrator Service**: Provides the API for saving, loading, and validating workflow definitions
* **Node Type Registry**: Provides metadata about available node types and their properties
* **User Authorization Service**: Controls edit permissions for workflows
* **Analytics Service**: Tracks canvas usage and common patterns

## Performance Requirements

* **Canvas Rendering Time**: < 500ms for workflows with up to 100 nodes
* **Interaction Response Time**: < 100ms for basic operations (select, move, create)
* **Save Operation**: < 2 seconds for complete workflow save
* **Memory Usage**: < 50MB of browser memory for typical workflows

## Security Requirements

* All workflow definitions must be associated with an owner and permissions
* Canvas must respect read/write permissions from the authorization service
* Sensitive configuration values must be masked in the UI unless explicitly revealed
* Canvas operations must be logged for audit purposes

## Accessibility Requirements

This feature must comply with:

* WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
* Keyboard navigation for all canvas operations
* Screen reader support for nodes and their connections
* Color contrast ratios meeting accessibility standards
* Alternative text-based view for workflow definition

## Error Handling

### Error Scenarios

* **Invalid Connection Attempt**:
  * **Cause**: User attempts to create an invalid edge (e.g., creating a cycle)
  * **Response**: Prevent edge creation, show validation message
  * **Recovery**: User must create a valid connection instead
  * **Message to User**: "This connection would create a cycle in the workflow, which is not allowed."
* **Node Configuration Error**:
  * **Cause**: Required property missing in node configuration
  * **Response**: Highlight the node and property field, prevent saving
  * **Recovery**: User must provide required properties
  * **Message to User**: "The \[Property Name\] is required for \[Node Type\] nodes."

## Acceptance Criteria


 1. Users can drag and drop at least 5 different node types onto the canvas from a palette
 2. Users can connect nodes with edges that respect the port compatibility rules
 3. Users can select nodes and edit their properties in a properties panel
 4. Users can move, resize, and delete nodes and edges
 5. Canvas validates the workflow and prevents invalid operations
 6. Users can save workflows and reload them with the exact same visual layout
 7. Canvas supports undo/redo for at least 20 operations
 8. Canvas allows zooming from 25% to 400% and panning across the entire workflow
 9. Canvas supports workflows with at least 100 nodes with acceptable performance
10. Canvas is fully accessible via keyboard controls and screen readers

## Feature Dependencies

This feature depends on:

* Workflow Definition Schema
* Node Type Registry API
* Workflow Storage API
* Authentication and Authorization Services
* Front-end Component Library

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly out of scope for this feature:

* Workflow execution or debugging within the canvas
* Custom code editing for node behavior
* Collaborative real-time editing (future feature)
* 3D visualizations or animations of workflow execution
* Mobile device support (responsive down to tablet, but not phone)

## Open Questions

* Should we support custom node appearances defined by users?
* What is the maximum supported workflow size before performance degrades?
* How should we handle very large workflows on smaller screens?
