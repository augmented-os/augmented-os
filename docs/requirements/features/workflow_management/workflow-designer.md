# Feature Specification: Workflow Canvas

## Overview

The Workflow Canvas is the core UI component that allows users to visually design, edit, and review workflow definitions. It provides a drag-and-drop interface for creating workflow nodes, connecting them with edges, and configuring their properties, enabling users to create complex workflow definitions without writing code. The canvas supports a rich set of node types for building sophisticated business processes, including automated tasks, human tasks, decision points, parallel execution, and event handling.

## User Stories

* As a workflow designer, I want to drag and drop nodes onto a canvas so that I can visually build my workflow.
* As a workflow designer, I want to connect nodes with edges so that I can define the flow of execution.
* As a workflow designer, I want to edit node properties via a properties panel so that I can configure how each step works.
* As a workflow designer, I want to validate my workflow before saving so that I can identify and fix issues early.
* As a workflow designer, I want to group related nodes together so that I can organize complex workflows.
* As a workflow designer, I want to zoom and pan around the canvas so that I can work with large workflows.
* As a workflow designer, I want to create conditional branches using decision nodes so that I can implement business logic.
* As a workflow designer, I want to define parallel execution paths so that I can optimize workflow performance.
* As a workflow designer, I want to include human tasks in my workflow so that I can handle steps requiring manual intervention.
* As a workflow designer, I want to configure event-waiting steps so that I can create event-driven workflows.
* As a workflow designer, I want to define and run tests for my workflow so that I can ensure it behaves correctly.
* As a workflow designer, I want to configure advanced workflow settings like error handling and compensation so that I can handle edge cases.

* Show a properties panel that updates based on the selected node
* Include a toolbar with common operations (save, load, undo, redo, etc.)

* Remain responsive and performant with workflows up to 100 nodes

See the related [Workflow Canvas UI/UX Documentation](../../ui_ux/wireframes/workflow_canvas.md) for detailed wireframes and mockups.

## Functional Behavior

### Core Behavior

The Workflow Canvas operates on a graph data model where nodes represent workflow tasks and edges represent execution flow. The canvas allows users to manipulate this graph visually:



1. Users can add nodes by dragging them from a palette onto the canvas
2. Users can connect nodes by creating edges from one node's output port to another node's input port
3. Users can configure nodes by selecting them and editing properties in a panel
4. Users can reposition nodes by dragging them around the canvas
5. Users can select multiple nodes using click+drag or Ctrl+click
6. The canvas validates the workflow structure and highlights issues

### States and Transitions

The canvas can exist in the following states:



1. **Empty State**: No nodes present, showing guidance to get started
2. **Editing State**: Active editing of workflow in progress
3. **Selection State**: One or more nodes selected, showing properties
4. **Edge Creation State**: User in process of creating an edge
5. **Validation Error State**: Workflow has validation errors that must be fixed
6. **Read-Only State**: Canvas is in view-only mode

### Algorithms and Logic

* **Layout Algorithm**: Force-directed graph layout with customizable parameters
* **Validation Logic**: Graph traversal to detect cycles, unreachable nodes, and configuration errors
* **Undo/Redo Stack**: Command pattern implementation for operation history
* **Selection Logic**: Rectangle and individual selection with standard modifier keys
* **Serialization Logic**: JSON schema-based serialization of workflow graph

## Data Requirements

For the complete schema definition and additional details, refer to the [Workflow Definitions Schema Documentation](../../../architecture/components/workflow_orchestrator_service/schemas/workflow_definitions.md).

### Data Storage

Workflow definitions will be stored in the workflow_definition table in the database, with the following structure:

* id (UUID): Unique identifier for the workflow
* name (String): Human-readable name of the workflow
* description (String): Optional description of the workflow
* definition (JSONB): The complete workflow definition in JSON format
* version (Integer): The version number of this workflow definition
* created_at (Timestamp): When the workflow was created
* updated_at (Timestamp): When the workflow was last updated
* created_by (UUID): User who created the workflow
* status (Enum): Draft, Published, Deprecated

### Data Inputs and Outputs

* **Input**: Workflow definition JSON loaded from the database or imported
* **Output**: Updated workflow definition JSON saved to the database or exported

## Integration Requirements

This feature integrates with:

* **Workflow Orchestrator Service**: Provides the API for saving, loading, and validating workflow definitions
* **Node Type Registry**: Provides metadata about available node types and their properties
* **User Authorization Service**: Controls edit permissions for workflows
* **Analytics Service**: Tracks canvas usage and common patterns

## Performance Requirements

* **Canvas Rendering Time**: < 500ms for workflows with up to 100 nodes
* **Interaction Response Time**: < 100ms for basic operations (select, move, create)
* **Save Operation**: < 2 seconds for complete workflow save
* **Memory Usage**: < 50MB of browser memory for typical workflows

## Security Requirements

* All workflow definitions must be associated with an owner and permissions
* Canvas must respect read/write permissions from the authorization service
* Sensitive configuration values must be masked in the UI unless explicitly revealed
* Canvas operations must be logged for audit purposes

## Accessibility Requirements

This feature must comply with:

* WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
* Keyboard navigation for all canvas operations
* Screen reader support for nodes and their connections
* Color contrast ratios meeting accessibility standards
* Alternative text-based view for workflow definition

## Error Handling

### Error Scenarios

* **Invalid Connection Attempt**:
  * **Cause**: User attempts to create an invalid edge (e.g., creating a cycle)
  * **Response**: Prevent edge creation, show validation message
  * **Recovery**: User must create a valid connection instead
  * **Message to User**: "This connection would create a cycle in the workflow, which is not allowed."
* **Node Configuration Error**:
  * **Cause**: Required property missing in node configuration
  * **Response**: Highlight the node and property field, prevent saving
  * **Recovery**: User must provide required properties
  * **Message to User**: "The \[Property Name\] is required for \[Node Type\] nodes."
* **Invalid Decision Expression**:
  * **Cause**: User enters an invalid condition expression in a decision node
  * **Response**: Highlight the expression field, show syntax error details
  * **Recovery**: User must correct the expression syntax
  * **Message to User**: "The condition expression is invalid: \[Error Details\]"
* **Incompatible Data Mapping**:
  * **Cause**: User attempts to map incompatible data types between nodes
  * **Response**: Highlight the incompatible fields, show type mismatch
  * **Recovery**: User must correct the data mapping or add transformation
  * **Message to User**: "Cannot map \[Source Type\] to \[Target Type\]. Please check the data mapping."
