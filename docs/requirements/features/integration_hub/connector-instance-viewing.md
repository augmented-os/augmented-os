# Feature Specification: Connector Instance Viewing

## Metadata
* **Name**: Connector Instance Viewing
* **Category**: Integration Hub
* **Created**: 2023-07-12
* **Last Updated**: 2023-07-12
* **Status**: Draft

## Overview
This feature allows users to view, browse, filter, and monitor existing Integration Instances (connections to external systems) within the Augmented OS platform.

## User Stories
* As an automation manager, I want to view all available connected systems so that I can understand what integrations are available for use in workflows
* As a business user, I want to see the status of my connected systems so that I can quickly identify any connection issues
* As a platform administrator, I want to monitor the health of all integrations so that I can proactively address potential problems
* As a developer, I want to inspect connection details so that I can troubleshoot integration issues

## Requirements

### Must Have
* Dashboard view of all accessible Integration Instances
* Status indicators for each connection (connected, error, pending)
* Basic filtering and searching capabilities
* Detailed view of individual connection configuration and status
* Last connection test results
* Access controls based on user permissions

### Should Have
* Advanced filtering options (by system type, status, usage, etc.)
* Sorting capabilities (alphabetical, status, last used, etc.)
* Usage statistics for each connection
* Historical status timeline
* Connection health metrics
* Bulk actions for managing multiple connections

### Could Have
* Visual representation of connection dependencies
* Real-time status updates
* Integration analytics (usage patterns, error rates, etc.)
* Custom views and saved filters
* Notification system for connection status changes
* Export functionality for connection inventory

### Won't Have
* Direct modification of Integration Definitions through this interface
* Deep performance analytics (should be handled in dedicated monitoring features)
* Direct access to raw credential data

## Technical Requirements

### UI Requirements
* List view with status indicators for all accessible Integration Instances
* Detailed view with configuration details, status history, and test results
* Search bar with typeahead functionality
* Filter controls for narrowing visible connections
* Status badge system with clear visual indicators
* Quick action buttons for common operations (test, edit, disable)

## Data Requirements

### Data Model
The feature primarily works with the Integration Instance model:

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "integrationDefinitionId": "string",
  "integrationDefinition": {
    "name": "string",
    "description": "string",
    "version": "string",
    "category": "string",
    "icon": "string"
  },
  "status": "connected|error|pending",
  "lastTested": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "lastTestResult": "success|failure",
  "healthMetrics": {
    "uptimePercentage": "number",
    "responseTime": "number",
    "errorRate": "number"
  },
  "usage": {
    "lastUsed": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
    "totalCalls": "number",
    "activeWorkflows": "number"
  },
  "createdAt": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "ISO-8601 timestamp"
}
```

For the complete schema definition and additional details, refer to the [Integration Service Schema Documentation](../../../architecture/components/integration_service/schema/README.md).

### Data Storage
The feature reads data from:
* Integration Instance records in the Integration database
* Connection status and health metrics from the monitoring system
* Usage statistics from the audit/usage tracking system

No direct data storage is required for this view-only feature.

### Data Inputs and Outputs
* **Input**: 
  * User queries and filter criteria
  * Access control permissions
* **Output**: 
  * Filtered and formatted Integration Instance listings
  * Detailed Connection views
  * Status reports and health metrics

### Integration Requirements
* Integration Service for retrieving connection details
* Monitoring Service for status and health information
* Audit Service for usage statistics
* Authentication Service for permission checks

## Performance Requirements
* Fast loading times for connection listings (<1s)
* Efficient filtering and searching with minimal delay
* Pagination for large connection inventories
* Optimized data loading (lazy loading details when needed)
* Support for environments with 1000+ connections

## Security Requirements
* Respect permission boundaries for connection visibility
* No exposure of sensitive credential data
* Audit logging of connection detail access
* Role-based access controls for advanced features

## Accessibility Requirements
* Screen reader compatible connection listings
* Keyboard navigable interface
* High contrast status indicators with non-color dependent states
* Descriptive error messages and status descriptions

## Acceptance Criteria
* [ ] User can view a list of all Integration Instances they have access to
* [ ] User can filter and search connections by various criteria
* [ ] System displays accurate status indicators for each connection
* [ ] User can view detailed information about a specific connection
* [ ] Health metrics and usage statistics are displayed where available
* [ ] Permission controls correctly limit visibility of connections

## Dependencies
* Integration Service implementation
* Monitoring Service for status data
* Audit Service for usage statistics
* Authentication Service for access control

## Notes
This feature complements the Connector Instance Creation feature by providing visibility into existing connections. The interface should prioritize quick status assessment while offering detailed information when needed.
