# Feature Specification: Connector Instance Creation

## Metadata
* **Name**: Connector Instance Creation
* **Category**: Integration Hub
* **Created**: 2023-07-12
* **Last Updated**: 2023-07-12
* **Status**: Draft

## Overview
This feature allows users to set up and authenticate a connection (an Integration Instance) to an external system (like Salesforce, Stripe, Slack, etc.) using a pre-defined Integration Definition within the Augmented OS platform.

## User Stories
* As an automation manager, I want to establish a connected instance to an external system so that I can use it in my workflows
* As a business user, I want to connect my company's external services to the platform so that data can flow between systems
* As a platform administrator, I want to set up connections with appropriate permissions so that users can safely interact with external systems

## Requirements

### Must Have
* Integration catalog with searchable/browsable list of available integration definitions
* Ability to create and name multiple instances of the same integration (e.g., "Salesforce - Production", "Salesforce - Testing")
* Dynamic configuration form based on the integration's configSchema
* Support for various authentication methods (OAuth2, API Key, Basic Auth)
* Secure credential storage
* Default connection testing capability
* Status tracking for connection health

### Should Have
* Permissions management for connection instances at different scopes (global, client, user)
* Detailed error reporting during connection setup and testing
* Ability to save successful tests for future monitoring
* Diagnostic information for failed connection tests
* Ability to edit and re-authenticate existing connections

### Could Have
* Guided setup wizards customized for popular external systems
* Connection templates for commonly used configurations
* Advanced testing console for custom validation
* Connection usage tracking
* Automated credential refresh for OAuth integrations

### Won't Have
* Direct editing of Integration Definitions through this interface
* Automatic setup of external system configurations (users must have appropriate access in the external system)

## Technical Requirements

### UI Requirements
* Integration catalog interface with search, filter, and selection capabilities
* Multi-step setup wizard for connection configuration
* Dynamic form rendering based on integration's configSchema
* OAuth redirect handling and completion detection
* Secure input fields for credentials
* Connection testing interface with request/response visualization
* Status indicators for connection health

## Data Requirements

### Data Model
The primary data model for this feature is the Integration Instance:

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "integrationDefinitionId": "string",
  "configuration": {
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
  },
  "scope": {
    "type": "global|client|user",
    "id": "string" 
  },
  "permissions": {
    "roles": ["role1", "role2"]
  },
  "status": "pending|connected|error",
  "authType": "oauth2|apiKey|basicAuth|custom",
  "credentialId": "string",
  "lastTested": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "lastTestResult": "success|failure",
  "createdAt": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "ISO-8601 timestamp"
}
```

For the complete schema definition and additional details, refer to the [Integration Service Schema Documentation](../../../architecture/components/integration_service/schema/README.md).

### Data Storage
Integration Instance records are stored in the Integration database, with sensitive credentials stored separately in the secure Credential Manager. Key data includes:

* Integration Instance records (configuration, metadata, status)
* Authentication credentials (encrypted, managed by Credential Manager)
* Test configurations and results

### Data Inputs and Outputs
* **Input**: 
  * Integration Definition references
  * User-provided configuration parameters
  * Authentication credentials
  * Test configurations
* **Output**: 
  * Configured Integration Instances
  * Connection status and health metrics
  * Test results and diagnostics

### Integration Requirements
* Credential Manager for secure storage of authentication tokens and secrets
* Integration Definitions catalog with configSchema and authType specifications
* OAuth2 redirect handling mechanism
* HTTP client for testing external system connectivity

## Performance Requirements
* Quick response times (<2s) for catalog browsing and form rendering
* Efficient credential encryption/decryption (<500ms)
* Connection test completion within reasonable timeframe (<5s for most integrations)
* Support for concurrent connection setups by multiple users

## Security Requirements
* Encryption of all stored credentials and secrets
* Secure handling of OAuth tokens
* No logging of sensitive information
* HTTPS for all external system communications
* Appropriate permission checks before accessing connection instances
* Audit logging for connection creation and modification

## Accessibility Requirements
* Clear error messages with troubleshooting guidance
* Keyboard navigable setup flow
* Screen reader compatibility for all form fields
* High-contrast status indicators

## Acceptance Criteria
* [ ] User can browse and search the Integration Catalog
* [ ] User can create a new Integration Instance with a unique name
* [ ] System generates a dynamic configuration form based on the Integration Definition's configSchema
* [ ] User can authenticate using all supported authentication methods
* [ ] Credentials are stored securely
* [ ] User can successfully test a connection
* [ ] Connection status is accurately tracked and displayed
* [ ] User can edit an existing Integration Instance
* [ ] User can manage connection permissions

## Dependencies
* Integration Service implementation
* Authentication Service for user authorization
* Credential Manager for secure credential storage
* Integration Definitions catalog

## Notes
This feature is fundamental to the platform's integration capabilities. The user experience should prioritize clarity, security, and feedback to ensure users can successfully establish connections even with limited technical knowledge of the external systems.
