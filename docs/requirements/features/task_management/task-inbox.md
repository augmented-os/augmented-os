# Feature Specification: Task Inbox

## Metadata
* **Name**: Task Inbox
* **Category**: Task Management
* **Created**: 2023-07-12
* **Last Updated**: 2023-07-12

## Overview
The Task Inbox feature provides a central hub for users to discover, manage, and monitor tasks that require human attention within the AugmentedOS platform. It offers a card-based interface that displays tasks in context of their parent workflows, with powerful filtering, sorting, and organization capabilities. The Task Inbox focuses primarily on manual tasks that require user input and exception cases from automated processes, serving as the primary entry point for task execution and workflow monitoring.

## Notes
The Task Inbox feature focuses on visualizing and managing human-centered tasks, specifically manual tasks and exception cases from automated processes. It does not replace or duplicate the Workflow Monitoring features, which provide a process-centric view of entire workflows. Task cards are the primary UI element, providing quick visual assessment of task status and priority without previews or hover states. When a user needs more details, they click directly on a card to view the complete task information including its workflow context. The feature emphasizes both individual productivity for knowledge workers and workload management for team leads and operations managers.
