- **[Security](./security/)**: Requirements for system security, authentication, and data protection
- **[Compliance](./compliance/)**: Requirements for regulatory compliance and standards conformance

## How to Use This Documentation

Cross-cutting requirements documentation should be referenced when:

- Designing system architecture
- Implementing features that must meet specific non-functional requirements
- Testing non-functional aspects of the system
- Evaluating system quality attributes
- Planning system enhancements or changes that might affect non-functional characteristics
