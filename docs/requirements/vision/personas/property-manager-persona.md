* **Role/Occupation**: Owner & Property Manager
* **Organization Size**: Small Business (8-10 team members: 5-6 VAs, 3 office staff, outsourced maintenance and housekeeping)
* **Technical Proficiency**: Intermediate - Comfortable with digital tools, can handle basic configurations, but relies on platforms for complex automations.

## Goals and Motivations

### Primary Goals

* Automate guest communication flows (booking confirmations, check-in instructions, mid-stay check-ins, check-out procedures).
* Efficiently coordinate maintenance and housekeeping services with minimal manual intervention.
* Monitor property performance metrics to optimize pricing and occupancy rates.
* Streamline task assignment and tracking for both in-house staff and virtual assistants.

* Scale the business without proportionally increasing administrative overhead.
* Maintain real-time visibility across the entire property portfolio.
* Reduce dependency on individual team members for critical processes.

## Pain Points and Frustrations

* **Fragmented Systems**: Tokeet (property management system) doesn't fully integrate with all necessary tools, causing manual data entry and synchronization issues.
* **Communication Gaps**: Difficulties coordinating between VAs, in-office staff, and outsourced service providers leads to occasional missed tasks.
* **Guest Communication Overhead**: Responding to similar guest queries repeatedly consumes significant time.
* **Maintenance Coordination**: Tracking maintenance requests, scheduling contractors, and following up on completion status is cumbersome and error-prone.
* **Calendar Management**: Ensuring consistency across multiple booking platforms and Tokeet requires constant vigilance.
* **Reporting Limitations**: Generating comprehensive performance reports requires pulling data from multiple sources.

## Behaviors and Preferences

* Detail-oriented with guest experience being the top priority.
* Prefers mobile-friendly tools that allow management on-the-go.
* Values systems that can run with minimal supervision once properly set up.

* Relies on WhatsApp and email for team communications.
* Uses cloud-based document storage for property information and guest guides.
* Comfortable with spreadsheets for tracking finances and property metrics.

### Communication Preferences

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Streamlining Guest Journey Automation

Sarah wants to create a comprehensive workflow that manages the entire guest journey from booking confirmation to post-stay follow-up. The workflow should: send personalized booking confirmations, schedule pre-arrival messages with check-in details, trigger check-in instructions on arrival day, schedule mid-stay check-ins for longer bookings, send check-out reminders, and follow up with review requests. Sarah uses the Augmented OS workflow designer to create this sequence, integrating with Tokeet for booking data and customizing messaging based on property type and booking duration.

### Scenario 2: Maintenance Request Handling

Sarah wants to automate the process of handling maintenance requests. She designs a workflow where incoming maintenance reports (from guests or cleaning staff) are categorized by urgency and type, assigned to the appropriate maintenance provider, tracked for completion, verified by the next cleaning staff, and reported back to Sarah only if issues persist. The workflow includes status notifications to all relevant parties and escalation procedures for unresolved issues. Sarah configures this in Augmented OS by connecting to her existing communication channels and maintenance contact database.
