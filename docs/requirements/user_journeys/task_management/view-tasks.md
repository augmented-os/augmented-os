## Overview

This user journey describes how users discover, view, filter, and monitor tasks requiring human attention within the AugmentedOS platform. It covers manual tasks assigned to users and exceptions/errors from automated processes that require human intervention. The journey includes the process of task discovery through the inbox interface, understanding task context, previewing task details, and monitoring task status.

## Primary Persona(s)

* Knowledge Worker - Primary user who needs to view and manage assigned tasks
* Team Lead - User who monitors multiple tasks across team members
* Operations Manager - User who oversees departmental task progress
* Exception Handler - Specialist who resolves issues with automated processes

## Journey Flow

1. **Starting Point**
   * Initial state: User logs into the AugmentedOS platform
   * User's goal: Discover and understand tasks requiring their attention or intervention

2. **Steps**
   * Step 1: Access Task Inbox
     * User Action: User navigates to the Task Management section and selects Task Inbox
     * System Response: System displays a grid of task cards with manual tasks and exceptions requiring attention, with default focus on tasks assigned to the user
     * Success Criteria: User sees an actionable collection of task cards with key information

   * Step 2: Apply View Mode
     * User Action: User selects a view mode (My Tasks, All Tasks, Team Tasks, Exception Queue)
     * System Response: System updates the task cards to match the selected view mode
     * Success Criteria: User can quickly switch between different task contexts

   * Step 3: Filter and Sort Tasks
     * User Action: User applies filters and sorts the task collection
     * System Response: System updates the displayed task cards to match the specified criteria
     * Success Criteria: User sees a filtered view of tasks matching their criteria
     * Available Filters:
       * **Assignment Filters**: Assigned to me, Assigned to role, Assigned to team, Unassigned, Created by me
       * **Task Type Filters**: Manual tasks, Exception tasks, Approval tasks, Review tasks
       * **Status Filters**: Pending, In Progress, Blocked, Escalated, Overdue
       * **Priority Filters**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
       * **Temporal Filters**: Due today, Due this week, Overdue, Recently updated
       * **Exception Type Filters**: Validation errors, System errors, Business rule violations, Integration failures
       * **Domain Filters**: By business domain, process area, or department

   * Step 4: Save and Manage Filter Sets
     * User Action: User saves a custom filter configuration with a name
     * System Response: System saves the filter set for future use
     * Success Criteria: User can quickly apply complex filter combinations

   * Step 5: View Detailed Task Information
     * User Action: User clicks on a task card to view full details
     * System Response: System displays comprehensive task information including description, workflow context, history, and available actions
     * Success Criteria: User has complete information needed to understand both the task and its workflow context

   * Step 6: Check Task Status and History
     * User Action: User selects the history or audit trail section of a task
     * System Response: System displays a chronological record of all task activities and status changes within the workflow
     * Success Criteria: User can track the full history and current status of the task and related workflow

   * Step 7: Monitor Task Updates
     * User Action: User enables notifications or keeps the task view open
     * System Response: System provides real-time updates on task status changes
     * Success Criteria: User receives timely information about task updates

3. **End State**
   * Final state: User has a clear understanding of tasks requiring attention, their priorities, deadlines, and position within broader workflows
   * Success indicators: User can make informed decisions about which tasks to execute next based on workflow priorities and dependencies

## Alternative Paths

* **Exception Queue View**: For handling automated task failures and exceptions
  * In Step 1, user selects "Exception Queue" option
  * System displays exceptions and errors from automated processes that require human intervention
  * User can filter by exception type, severity, and affected systems
* **Role-Based View**: For viewing tasks assigned to a specific role
  * In Step 3, user filters by "Assigned to role" and selects the relevant role
  * System displays all tasks assigned to that role, regardless of specific user assignment
  * Useful for role coverage and workload balancing
* **Team Management View**: For team leads to manage their team's workload
  * In Step 2, user selects "Team Tasks" view
  * System displays tasks for all team members with assignment information
  * User can reassign tasks between team members to balance workload
* **Dashboard View**: User prefers to see tasks in a dashboard format
  * After Step 1, user selects "Dashboard View" instead of list view
  * System presents tasks grouped by status, priority, or due date in a visual dashboard
  * User can drill down into specific task groups
* **Notification-driven Access**: User accesses task from a notification
  * User receives a notification about a new or updated task
  * User clicks on the notification
  * System navigates directly to the task details view

## Error Scenarios

* **Task Load Failure**
  * Trigger: Network issues or server problems prevent task data from loading
  * Recovery Path: System displays error message with retry option, cached data is shown if available
* **Invalid Filter Combination**
  * Trigger: User applies a combination of filters that returns no results
  * Recovery Path: System shows message indicating no matching tasks, suggests filter adjustments
* **Permission Denied**
  * Trigger: User attempts to view a task they don't have access to
  * Recovery Path: System displays permission error message and provides contact information for task owner
* **Task No Longer Exists**
  * Trigger: User tries to access a task that has been deleted or archived
  * Recovery Path: System displays notification that task is unavailable and redirects to inbox

## Notes

This journey focuses specifically on viewing and monitoring tasks that require human attention, including manual tasks and exceptions from automated processes. Each task is understood to be a single step within a larger workflow, and the UI emphasizes this context by consistently showing workflow progress and relationships. Tasks are presented visually as cards rather than in a traditional table format, providing better information density and visual prioritization. Each task card includes task title, associated entity, visual status indicators, completion status, and priority indicators. The system assumes that the Task Execution Service and notification systems are fully operational. Future enhancements may include advanced analytics for task monitoring and predictive task prioritization based on machine learning.
