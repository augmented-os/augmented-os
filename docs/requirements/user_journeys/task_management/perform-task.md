# User Journey: Perform and Complete Tasks

## Overview

This user journey describes how users execute and complete different types of tasks within the AugmentedOS platform. It covers the process of understanding task requirements, executing the necessary actions, handling task-specific interfaces, managing exceptions and errors, and submitting completed tasks. As each task is part of a larger workflow, the journey emphasizes the relationship between task completion and workflow progress.

## Primary Persona(s)

* Knowledge Worker - Primary user who executes assigned tasks
* Approval Authority - User who reviews and approves submitted items
* Data Specialist - User who performs data entry and validation tasks
* Decision Maker - User who makes decisions within workflow processes
* Exception Handler - User who resolves errors in automated processes

## Journey Flow


1. **Starting Point**
   * Initial state: User has selected a task to perform from their task inbox
   * User's goal: Successfully complete the assigned task according to requirements
2. **Steps**
   * Step 1: Review Task Requirements
     * User Action: User examines task description, instructions, input data, expected outputs, and workflow context
     * System Response: System presents comprehensive task information including workflow context and task-specific details
     * Success Criteria: User understands what needs to be done to complete the task and how it fits into the broader workflow
   * Step 2: Engage with Task-Specific Interface
     * User Action: User interacts with the specialized interface for the specific task type (approval, data entry, decision, or investigation)
     * System Response: System presents the appropriate interface components based on task type:
       * For Approval Tasks: Document previewer, approval options, delegation controls
       * For Data Entry Tasks: Smart forms with validation, data import tools, templates
       * For Decision Tasks: Option comparison tools, impact analysis, decision criteria framework
       * For Investigation Tasks: Evidence collection tools, analysis workspace, finding documentation
     * Success Criteria: User can efficiently interact with the task interface elements appropriate to the task type
   * Step 3: Perform Required Actions
     * User Action: User completes the necessary actions specific to the task type
     * System Response: System validates input in real-time using JSON schema validation and task-specific validation rules
     * Success Criteria: User completes all required task actions without validation errors
   * Step 4: Handle Additional Requirements
     * User Action: User addresses any supplementary task needs (attaching documents, adding comments, requesting information)
     * System Response: System processes and validates supplementary inputs
     * Success Criteria: All supporting elements of the task are properly addressed
   * Step 5: Review Before Submission
     * User Action: User reviews their work before final submission
     * System Response: System provides a summary view of all task inputs and actions, highlighting key decisions or data entered
     * Success Criteria: User confirms all inputs are accurate and complete
   * Step 6: Submit Completed Task
     * User Action: User submits the completed task
     * System Response: System performs final validation, updates task status to COMPLETED, records completion metadata (completedBy, completedAt), notifies the workflow orchestrator, and triggers the next workflow step
     * Success Criteria: Task is successfully submitted, workflow advances to the next step, and user receives confirmation
3. **End State**
   * Final state: Task is marked as COMPLETED, workflow instance is updated, and workflow advances to the next step
   * Success indicators: User receives confirmation, task appears in completed tasks list, next task in workflow is triggered

## Alternative Paths

* **Save Draft**
  * After Step 3 or 4, user chooses to save work in progress
  * System stores the current form data without changing task status
  * Task remains in the user's inbox with visual indication that it contains saved work
  * User can return later to complete the task with their saved inputs preserved
* **Reassign Task**
  * At any point, user determines they cannot complete the task
  * User selects "Reassign" option and provides reason
  * System opens reassignment dialog requesting new assignee selection
  * System updates task assignment (assignee_id and assignee_type) and sends notification to new assignee
  * Task appears in new assignee's inbox with reassignment history recorded
* **Request Additional Information**
  * During Step 3, user realizes they need more information
  * User selects "Request Information" option and specifies requirements
  * System creates a subtask linked to the original task
  * System notifies relevant parties based on the information request type
  * Original task enters WAITING status until the information request is fulfilled
* **Task Escalation**
  * User determines task needs higher authority attention
  * User selects "Escalate" option and provides justification
  * System follows escalation configuration defined in task definition or SLA rules
  * Task is assigned to escalation target (manager, specialized role, etc.)
  * Escalation event is recorded in task history and audit trail

## Error Scenarios

* **Validation Failure**
  * Trigger: User submits task with invalid or incomplete data
  * Recovery Path: System highlights validation errors with clear explanations using schema-based validation, allows user to correct and resubmit
* **System Processing Error**
  * Trigger: Backend error occurs during task processing
  * Recovery Path: System preserves user input, displays friendly error message, logs error details for diagnostics, and provides retry option
* **Dependency Failure**
  * Trigger: External system or dependency required for task completion is unavailable
  * Recovery Path: System notifies user of dependency issue, records the error in task.error field, offers option to save draft and retry later
* **Task Definition Error**
  * Trigger: Task has incorrect or incompatible definition
  * Recovery Path: System detects definition issues during task loading, routes error to system administrator, and provides user with explanation
* **Conflicting Updates**
  * Trigger: Multiple users attempt to update the same task simultaneously
  * Recovery Path: System implements optimistic concurrency control using version field, notifies user of conflict, and provides resolution options

## Notes

This journey focuses specifically on performing and completing tasks, not on discovering or monitoring them. Tasks are executed within the context of workflows, with the Task Execution Service handling the task lifecycle and the Workflow Orchestrator managing the broader workflow progression. The exact interface and actions will vary significantly based on task type (approval, data entry, decision, investigation), but this journey outlines the common flow across all task types.

The Manual Task Handler component implements much of the functionality for human task processing, including form rendering, validation, state management, and integration with the workflow orchestrator. Error handling uses structured error objects that are recorded in the task's error field and can trigger different responses based on error type and retry policies.
