# Documentation Format Guidelines

This document provides a concise reference for markdown documentation in the Augmented OS project. For complete examples, refer to the template files.

## Templates

Use these templates as starting points for new documentation:

* [Component Template](./templates/component-template.md)
* [Schema Template](./templates/schema-template.md)

## Essential Structure

Documentation should include these key sections:

1. **Title (H1)** - Component or schema name
2. **Overview** - Brief description of purpose and function
3. **Structure** - JSON schema or architectural diagram
4. **Implementation/Field Details** - Core functionality explanation
5. **Examples** - Practical usage examples with explanations
6. **Related Components** - Links to related documentation

## Key Formatting Guidelines

* Use appropriate heading levels (H1 for title, H2 for sections)
* Include language specification in code blocks (```json, ```sql)
* Use relative links to reference other documentation
* Include diagrams when helpful for understanding

## Review Checklist

Before submitting documentation, ensure it:
* Follows the template structure
* Contains all required sections
* Includes practical examples
* Links to related components

Documentation should be clear, concise, and focused on helping developers understand and use the component or schema effectively.
