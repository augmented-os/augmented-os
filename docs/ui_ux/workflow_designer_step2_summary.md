# Step 2 Completion Summary: Create Workflow Designer UI/UX Directory Structure

## Completed Tasks

We have successfully completed all tasks in Step 2 of the Workflow Designer UI/UX Documentation implementation plan:


1. ✅ Created the workflow designer UI/UX directory structure following the exact pattern in workflow-designer-structure.md:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p docs/ui_ux/features/workflow_designer
   mkdir -p docs/ui_ux/features/workflow_designer/layout
   mkdir -p docs/ui_ux/features/workflow_designer/canvas
   mkdir -p docs/ui_ux/features/workflow_designer/nodes
   mkdir -p docs/ui_ux/features/workflow_designer/panels
   mkdir -p docs/ui_ux/features/workflow_designer/assets
   ```
2. ✅ Created README.md in the workflow_designer directory explaining the purpose
3. ✅ Verified structure exists by running `find docs/ui_ux/features/workflow_designer -type d | sort`

## Deliverables Created


1. **Directory Structure**
   * Created a complete directory structure for the workflow designer UI/UX documentation
   * Organized following the same pattern as the feature documentation structure
2. **docs/ui_ux/features/workflow_designer/README.md**
   * Overview of the workflow designer UI/UX documentation
   * Purpose statement for the documentation
   * Directory structure explanation
   * Core design principles
   * References to related documentation

## Verification

Confirmed that all required directories exist with the proper structure:

```
docs/ui_ux/features/workflow_designer
docs/ui_ux/features/workflow_designer/assets
docs/ui_ux/features/workflow_designer/canvas
docs/ui_ux/features/workflow_designer/layout
docs/ui_ux/features/workflow_designer/nodes
docs/ui_ux/features/workflow_designer/panels
```

## Next Steps

Upon confirmation, we will proceed to Step 3:

* Create the main overview documentation
* Add comprehensive workflow designer UI/UX overview
* Include visual design principles, navigation, and references
