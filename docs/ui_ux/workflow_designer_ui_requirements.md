# Workflow Designer UI/UX Requirements

This document summarizes the key UI/UX requirements and considerations for the Workflow Designer component based on the feature specifications and user journeys.

## Core UI Components

1. **Canvas Area**
   - Grid background for alignment
   - Visual representation of workflow nodes and edges
   - Zoom and pan capabilities for working with large workflows
   - Selection functionality for nodes and groups
   - Drag-and-drop interaction for node positioning

2. **Node Palette**
   - Visual catalog of available node types
   - Categorized organization of nodes
   - Drag-and-drop functionality for adding nodes to canvas
   - Visual indicators for different node types

3. **Properties Panel**
   - Context-sensitive configuration based on selected element
   - Form-based editing for node properties
   - Input/output mapping configuration
   - Validation feedback for configuration errors

4. **Toolbar**
   - Common operations (save, load, undo, redo)
   - Validation controls
   - Testing controls
   - View options

5. **Layout Components**
   - Header with workflow name and menu items
   - Panel system for different configuration contexts
   - Resizable panels for workspace customization

## Node Visualization Requirements

1. **Visual Differentiation**
   - Distinct visual appearance for different node types
   - Status indicators for validation state
   - Selection state visual feedback

2. **Node Types Visual Characteristics**
   - CODE Nodes: Code-focused appearance with script indicators
   - AI_AGENT Nodes: AI-related visual elements
   - INTEGRATION Nodes: Connection-focused appearance
   - HUMAN_TASK Nodes: Person/user-focused visual elements
   - DECISION Nodes: Branching/conditional visual indicators
   - PARALLEL Nodes: Concurrent execution visual elements
   - EVENT_WAIT Nodes: Event/waiting visual indicators
   - Start/End Nodes: Clear boundary indicators

## Interaction Patterns

1. **Canvas Interactions**
   - Drag to reposition nodes
   - Click to select nodes
   - Click+drag to create selection rectangle
   - Ctrl+click for multi-selection
   - Drag between ports to create edges
   - Mouse wheel or pinch for zoom
   - Click+drag empty canvas for panning
   - Double-click for quick property access

2. **Panel Interactions**
   - Expand/collapse for space management
   - Tab navigation between panels
   - Form interactions for property configuration
   - Drag handles for resizing

3. **Validation Feedback**
   - Real-time visual indicators for errors
   - Hover tooltips for error details
   - Linking between error descriptions and problematic elements

## Visual Design Considerations

1. **Color System**
   - Status colors (valid, error, warning)
   - Node type color coding
   - Selection highlighting
   - Background/foreground contrast for readability

2. **Layout Principles**
   - Grid alignment
   - Whitespace management
   - Panel organization
   - Responsive behavior for different screen sizes

3. **Typography**
   - Hierarchy for node labels, properties, and messages
   - Readability at different zoom levels
   - Consistent text styling

## Accessibility Requirements

1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Tab order for interactive elements
   - Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
   - Arrow key navigation on canvas

2. **Screen Reader Support**
   - Alt text for node icons
   - ARIA labels for interactive elements
   - Meaningful error messages

3. **Visual Accessibility**
   - Sufficient color contrast
   - Non-color-dependent status indicators
   - Resizable text

## Responsive Behavior

1. **Panel Management**
   - Collapsible panels for small screens
   - Responsive layout adjustment
   - Touch-friendly interaction targets for mobile/tablet use

2. **Viewport Adaptation**
   - Canvas scaling for different screen sizes
   - Minimap for navigation on small screens
   - Optimized toolbar for limited screen real estate

## User Experience Flows

1. **Initial Experience**
   - Empty state guidance for new workflows
   - Quick access to templates
   - Getting started tooltips

2. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Basic properties shown by default
   - Advanced options in expandable sections
   - Context-sensitive help

3. **Feedback Mechanisms**
   - Save confirmation
   - Validation status updates
   - Operation success/failure notifications

## Verification Against Acceptance Criteria

This document addresses the following acceptance criteria from the Workflow Designer requirements:

1. **UI/UX Documentation Structure**
   - We will follow the established structure as outlined in workflow-designer-structure.md
   - All components will be documented in their respective files and organized in the correct folder structure

2. **Wireframes**
   - We will include wireframes for all workflow designer interface components in their respective documentation files
   - Each component's visual appearance will be detailed with clear visual examples

3. **Interaction Patterns**
   - We have documented the core interaction patterns for all user actions 
   - Each component will have detailed interaction specifications

4. **Visual Design Specifications**
   - We have outlined the visual design considerations for all workflow designer components
   - Each component will have detailed visual specifications including colors, typography, and layout principles

5. **Cross-References**
   - We will include references to relevant feature documentation in each component document
   - Links between documents will be properly functioning

This document serves as a reference for implementing the UI/UX aspects of the Workflow Designer. The detailed specifications for each component will be developed in their respective documentation files following the structure outlined in the workflow-designer-structure.md document.
