# Workflow Designer UI/UX Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the UI/UX documentation for the Workflow Designer component, a core feature of the platform that allows users to visually create, edit, and manage workflow definitions. These documents focus specifically on the visual design, interaction patterns, and user experience specifications of the workflow designer.

The Workflow Designer provides a drag-and-drop interface where users can:
- Create workflow definitions by adding and connecting nodes
- Configure node properties through specialized panels
- Test workflow execution directly from the design interface
- Validate workflow structure before deployment
- Organize complex workflows with grouping and annotation tools

As a visual tool, the Workflow Designer emphasizes clarity, consistency, and feedback to ensure users can efficiently create complex workflows without getting overwhelmed by technical details.

## Purpose

The documentation in this directory serves as the reference for developers implementing the frontend components of the Workflow Designer. It builds upon the functional requirements specified in the [Workflow Designer Feature Documentation](../../../requirements/features/workflow_management/workflow-designer.md) but focuses specifically on the visual appearance and interaction aspects.

## Directory Structure

The documentation is organized into the following sections:

* **[layout/](./layout/)**: Top-level layout structure, including header and overall component arrangement
* **[canvas/](./canvas/)**: Canvas appearance, interaction behavior, validation, and organization
* **[nodes/](./nodes/)**: Visual design and behavior for all node types
* **[panels/](./panels/)**: Configuration panels and their interaction design
* **[assets/](./assets/)**: Visual assets used across documentation (wireframes, icons, etc.)

## Design Principles

The Workflow Designer UI/UX follows these core design principles:

1. **Visual Clarity**: All elements have clear visual distinction to help users understand the workflow structure at a glance
2. **Interactive Feedback**: The system provides immediate visual feedback for all user actions
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex options are revealed progressively to minimize initial cognitive load
4. **Consistency**: Visual language and interaction patterns are consistent throughout the interface
5. **Accessibility**: The design accommodates users with diverse abilities and preferences

## Visual Language

The Workflow Designer implements a cohesive visual language that conveys meaning through:

1. **Shape**: Different node types use distinct shapes to indicate their function
2. **Color**: A consistent color palette differentiates node types and indicates states
3. **Iconography**: Custom icons represent node functions and available actions
4. **Typography**: Clear hierarchy through consistent text styling and sizing
5. **Motion**: Purposeful animations provide feedback and guide attention

## General Design System Integration

The Workflow Designer UI/UX follows the platform's general design system while extending it for specialized workflow visualization needs:

1. **Component Library**: Uses the platform's standard UI components where appropriate
   - Buttons, form controls, and dialogs follow global component patterns
   - Custom canvas elements maintain visual consistency with standard components
   - Panel layouts align with standard information hierarchy patterns

2. **Color System**: Implements the platform's color palette with workflow-specific extensions
   - Uses primary, secondary, and accent colors from the global system
   - Extends with specialized node type colors that harmonize with the global palette
   - Maintains consistent state colors (error, warning, success) from the global system

3. **Typography**: Follows the platform's typography standards
   - Uses the standard font family and size scale
   - Maintains consistent heading hierarchy and text styles
   - Ensures font weights and line heights match global specifications

4. **Spacing System**: Adheres to the platform's spacing grid
   - Canvas grid aligns with the platform's spacing units
   - Panel layouts follow the same spacing guidelines as other platform components
   - Maintains consistent margins, padding, and component spacing

5. **Interaction Patterns**: Extends global interaction patterns for canvas-specific needs
   - Maintains consistency with platform's hover, focus, and active states
   - Canvas-specific interactions (node dragging, connection drawing) follow platform interaction principles
   - Error and validation feedback matches global pattern
