# [Component Name] Internal Interfaces

## Overview

This document describes the internal interfaces used by the [Component Name] Service for communication with other system components. These interfaces are not exposed externally and are intended for internal system integration only.

## Interface Types

The [Component Name] Service uses the following types of internal interfaces:

<!-- Customize based on actual interface types -->
* **Event-based interfaces**: Asynchronous communication via the event bus
* **Service-to-service APIs**: Direct synchronous communication with other services
* **Shared database access**: Direct database access patterns (when applicable)

## Event-Based Interfaces

### Published Events

The [Component Name] Service publishes the following events to the event bus:

| Event Type | Description | Payload Schema | Consumers |
|------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| `[component].[resource].[action]` | [Description of when this event is published] | [Link to schema](#event-schemas) | [List of consuming components] |
| `[component].[resource].[action]` | [Description of when this event is published] | [Link to schema](#event-schemas) | [List of consuming components] |
| `[component].[resource].[action]` | [Description of when this event is published] | [Link to schema](#event-schemas) | [List of consuming components] |

### Subscribed Events

The [Component Name] Service subscribes to the following events:

| Event Type | Description | Publisher | Handler |
|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| `[component].[resource].[action]` | [Description of the event] | [Publishing component] | [Description of how the event is handled] |
| `[component].[resource].[action]` | [Description of the event] | [Publishing component] | [Description of how the event is handled] |
| `[component].[resource].[action]` | [Description of the event] | [Publishing component] | [Description of how the event is handled] |

## Service-to-Service APIs

### Outbound Service Calls

The [Component Name] Service makes the following calls to other services:

| Service | Endpoint | Purpose | Error Handling |
|---------|----------|---------|---------------|
| [Service Name] | `[HTTP method] [path]` | [Description of why this call is made] | [How errors are handled] |
| [Service Name] | `[HTTP method] [path]` | [Description of why this call is made] | [How errors are handled] |
| [Service Name] | `[HTTP method] [path]` | [Description of why this call is made] | [How errors are handled] |

### Inbound Service Calls

The [Component Name] Service exposes the following internal endpoints for other services:

| Endpoint | Purpose | Callers | Authentication |
|----------|---------|---------|---------------|
| `[HTTP method] [path]` | [Description of the endpoint's purpose] | [List of calling services] | [Authentication method] |
| `[HTTP method] [path]` | [Description of the endpoint's purpose] | [List of calling services] | [Authentication method] |
| `[HTTP method] [path]` | [Description of the endpoint's purpose] | [List of calling services] | [Authentication method] |

## Shared Database Access

<!-- Include this section only if applicable -->

The [Component Name] Service shares database access with the following components:

| Component | Shared Tables/Collections | Access Pattern | Coordination Mechanism |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| [Component Name] | [List of shared tables] | [Read-only/Read-write] | [How access is coordinated] |
| [Component Name] | [List of shared tables] | [Read-only/Read-write] | [How access is coordinated] |

## Event Schemas

### [Event Type 1]

```json
{
  "type": "[component].[resource].[action]",
  "id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "data": {
    "[field1]": "[type]",
    "[field2]": "[type]",
    "[field3]": {
      "[nested1]": "[type]",
      "[nested2]": "[type]"
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "correlationId": "uuid",
    "source": "[component-name]"
  }
}
```

### [Event Type 2]

```json
{
  "type": "[component].[resource].[action]",
  "id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "data": {
    "[field1]": "[type]",
    "[field2]": "[type]",
    "[field3]": "[type]"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "correlationId": "uuid",
    "source": "[component-name]"
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Retry Policies

The [Component Name] Service implements the following retry policies for internal communication:

| Interface Type | Retry Strategy | Backoff | Max Retries | Circuit Breaking |
|----------------|----------------|---------|-------------|------------------|
| Event Publishing | [Strategy] | [Backoff pattern] | [Number] | [Yes/No with threshold] |
| Service Calls | [Strategy] | [Backoff pattern] | [Number] | [Yes/No with threshold] |

### Fallback Mechanisms

When communication with dependent services fails, the following fallback mechanisms are used:

| Dependency | Fallback Approach | Impact |
|------------|-------------------|--------|
| [Dependency 1] | [Description of fallback] | [Impact on functionality] |
| [Dependency 2] | [Description of fallback] | [Impact on functionality] |
