# Scaling Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides guidance on scaling the [Component Name] Service to handle increased load, maintain performance, and ensure reliability. It covers horizontal and vertical scaling strategies, resource requirements, and performance characteristics under different load conditions.

## Resource Requirements

### Base Requirements

The [Component Name] Service has the following base resource requirements per instance:

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------------|-------|
| CPU | [X] cores | [Y] cores | [Additional notes] |
| Memory | [X] GB | [Y] GB | [Additional notes] |
| Disk | [X] GB | [Y] GB | [SSD recommended for [specific reason]] |
| Network | [X] Mbps | [Y] Mbps | [Additional notes] |

### Scaling Factors

The following factors influence resource requirements:

| Factor | Impact | Scaling Recommendation |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| [Factor 1] | [Description of impact] | [Specific recommendation] |
| [Factor 2] | [Description of impact] | [Specific recommendation] |
| [Factor 3] | [Description of impact] | [Specific recommendation] |

## Performance Characteristics

### Throughput

The [Component Name] Service has been tested with the following throughput characteristics:

| Configuration | Operations/Second | Latency (P95) | Resource Utilization |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| [X] instances, [Y] CPU, [Z] GB RAM | [Number] | [Time] ms | CPU: [%], Memory: [%] |
| [X] instances, [Y] CPU, [Z] GB RAM | [Number] | [Time] ms | CPU: [%], Memory: [%] |
| [X] instances, [Y] CPU, [Z] GB RAM | [Number] | [Time] ms | CPU: [%], Memory: [%] |

### Bottlenecks

The following bottlenecks have been identified:

| Bottleneck | Symptoms | Mitigation |
|------------|----------|------------|
| [Bottleneck 1] | [Observable symptoms] | [Mitigation strategy] |
| [Bottleneck 2] | [Observable symptoms] | [Mitigation strategy] |
| [Bottleneck 3] | [Observable symptoms] | [Mitigation strategy] |

## Horizontal Scaling

The [Component Name] Service is designed to scale horizontally by adding more instances.

### Scaling Strategy

1. **Instance Sizing**: Each instance should be provisioned with [X] CPU cores and [Y] GB of memory
2. **Load Balancing**: Requests should be distributed using [load balancing strategy]
3. **Scaling Triggers**: Add instances when [specific metric] exceeds [threshold] for [duration]
4. **Maximum Instances**: The service has been tested with up to [X] instances

### Stateful Considerations

<!-- Include if the service maintains state -->
The [Component Name] Service maintains the following state that must be considered when scaling:

| State Type | Storage | Scaling Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|---------|----------------|------------|
| [State 1] | [Storage mechanism] | [Impact when scaling] | [Mitigation approach] |
| [State 2] | [Storage mechanism] | [Impact when scaling] | [Mitigation approach] |

## Vertical Scaling

While horizontal scaling is preferred, vertical scaling can be used in the following scenarios:

| Scenario | Vertical Scaling Approach | Limitations |
|----------|---------------------------|------------|
| [Scenario 1] | [Approach] | [Limitations] |
| [Scenario 2] | [Approach] | [Limitations] |

### Resource Allocation Guidelines

When vertically scaling, prioritize resources in this order:

1. **[Resource 1]**: Increase when [condition]
2. **[Resource 2]**: Increase when [condition]
3. **[Resource 3]**: Increase when [condition]

## Database Scaling

The [Component Name] Service interacts with databases that require their own scaling considerations:

| Database | Scaling Strategy | Connection Pool Sizing | Indexing Recommendations |
|----------|------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| [Database 1] | [Strategy] | [Connection pool formula] | [Key indexes to maintain] |
| [Database 2] | [Strategy] | [Connection pool formula] | [Key indexes to maintain] |

## Caching Strategy

The [Component Name] Service uses caching to improve performance:

| Cache Type | Purpose | Sizing Guidelines | Eviction Policy |
|------------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| [Cache 1] | [Purpose] | [Sizing formula] | [Policy] |
| [Cache 2] | [Purpose] | [Sizing formula] | [Policy] |

## Regional Deployment

For multi-region deployments, consider the following:

| Aspect | Recommendation | Rationale |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Data Replication | [Approach] | [Rationale] |
| Request Routing | [Approach] | [Rationale] |
| Failover Strategy | [Approach] | [Rationale] |

## Load Testing Results

The following load tests have been conducted:

### Steady Load Test

* **Duration**: [X] hours
* **Request Rate**: [Y] requests/second
* **Results**: [Summary of results]

### Spike Test

* **Baseline**: [X] requests/second
* **Spike**: [Y] requests/second for [Z] minutes
* **Results**: [Summary of results]

### Endurance Test

* **Duration**: [X] days
* **Request Rate**: [Y] requests/second
* **Results**: [Summary of results]
