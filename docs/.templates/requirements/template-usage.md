# Requirements Documentation Template Usage Guide

This guide explains how to use the provided templates to create comprehensive requirements documentation for the system.

## Overview

The requirements documentation templates provide a standardized structure for documenting system requirements from a user-centric perspective. Using these templates ensures consistency across requirements documentation and helps both product and engineering teams understand what needs to be built.

## Available Templates

The following templates are available:

1. **Vision Template** (`vision-template.md`)
   * Use for system overviews, personas, and goals
   * Flexible structure adapts to different vision document types
   * Includes sections for all vision-related content

2. **User Journey Template** (`user-journey-template.md`)
   * Use for documenting end-to-end user experiences
   * Captures user flows, alternative paths, and error scenarios
   * Links to related features and UI components

3. **Feature Template** (`feature-template.md`)
   * Use for detailed feature specifications
   * Includes user stories, requirements, and acceptance criteria
   * Covers technical requirements and dependencies

4. **UI/UX Template** (`ui-ux-template.md`)
   * Use for wireframes, mockups, and prototypes
   * Documents screen elements and interactions
   * Includes responsive and accessibility considerations

5. **Cross-Cutting Template** (`cross-cutting-template.md`)
   * Use for performance, security, and compliance requirements
   * Defines metrics, targets, and validation approaches
   * Documents impact on system components

## Using the Templates

### 1. Vision Documentation

Use the vision template for different types of vision documents:

```bash
# For system overview
cp docs/.templates/requirements/vision-template.md docs/requirements/vision/overview/system-overview.md

# For user persona
cp docs/.templates/requirements/vision-template.md docs/requirements/vision/personas/admin-user.md

# For system goal
cp docs/.templates/requirements/vision-template.md docs/requirements/vision/goals/scalability.md
```

### 2. User Journey Documentation

Document user journeys using the journey template:

```bash
cp docs/.templates/requirements/user-journey-template.md docs/requirements/user_journeys/workflow_management/create-workflow.md
```

### 3. Feature Documentation

Create feature specifications using the feature template:

```bash
cp docs/.templates/requirements/feature-template.md docs/requirements/features/workflow_designer/canvas-editor.md
```

### 4. UI/UX Documentation

Document UI/UX specifications using the UI/UX template:

```bash
cp docs/.templates/requirements/ui-ux-template.md docs/requirements/ui_ux/wireframes/workflow-canvas.md
```

### 5. Cross-Cutting Requirements

Document cross-cutting requirements using the cross-cutting template:

```bash
cp docs/.templates/requirements/cross-cutting-template.md docs/requirements/cross_cutting/performance/api-response-times.md
```

## Documentation Best Practices

1. **Be Specific and Measurable**: Use clear, specific language and include measurable criteria wherever possible.
2. **Focus on User Needs**: Keep the documentation user-centric, focusing on solving real user problems.
3. **Include Context**: Provide enough context for readers to understand the "why" behind requirements.
4. **Maintain Consistency**: Use consistent terminology and formatting throughout the documentation.
5. **Keep Documentation Updated**: Regularly review and update documentation as requirements evolve.
6. **Use Cross-References**: Link related documentation to help readers navigate the requirements.
7. **Include Visuals**: Use diagrams, wireframes, and other visual elements to enhance understanding.
8. **Prioritize Requirements**: Clearly distinguish between must-have, should-have, could-have, and won't-have requirements.
9. **Document Assumptions**: Explicitly state any assumptions that underlie the requirements.
10. **Involve Stakeholders**: Collaborate with stakeholders to ensure requirements accurately reflect needs.
