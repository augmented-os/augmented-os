# Task System Overview

## Introduction

The Augmented OS Task System is a structured approach to defining, organizing, and executing work within the project. It provides a standardized format for tasks that can be understood and executed by both human developers and AI assistants, ensuring consistency and clarity across the project.

## Purpose and Benefits

The Task System serves several key purposes:

1. **Standardization**: Provides a consistent format for defining work, making tasks easier to understand and execute.
2. **Clarity**: Ensures all necessary information is included with each task, reducing ambiguity.
3. **Traceability**: Allows for tracking of task status, dependencies, and progress.
4. **Collaboration**: Facilitates better collaboration between human developers and AI assistants.
5. **Prioritization**: Enables effective work prioritization based on clear metadata.
6. **Documentation**: Creates a self-documenting history of project development.

## System Architecture

The Task System is integrated into the overall Augmented OS architecture as follows:

```

│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The Task System serves as the central coordination mechanism for work within the project, directing both human and AI efforts toward specific, well-defined objectives.

## Task Organization

Tasks in the Augmented OS project are organized into directories based on their status and priority:

- **1-now/**: High-priority tasks that are currently being worked on
- **2-next/**: Tasks that are queued to be worked on next
- **3-later/**: Lower-priority tasks for future consideration
- **4-completed/**: Tasks that have been successfully completed

This organization allows for easy visualization of the project's current focus and upcoming work.

## Task Lifecycle

Each task follows a standard lifecycle:

1. **Creation**: Task is defined using the standard template
2. **Prioritization**: Task is placed in the appropriate directory
3. **Execution**: Task is worked on by human developers or AI assistants
4. **Verification**: Task completion is verified against acceptance criteria
5. **Completion**: Task is moved to the completed directory
