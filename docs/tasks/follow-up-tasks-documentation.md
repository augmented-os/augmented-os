## Fix "Service Service" Duplication in Documentation

**Status:** Completed

**Priority:** Medium

**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours

**Description:**
Remove duplicated "Service Service" text from multiple documentation files to improve readability and consistency across the codebase.

**Context:**
There are multiple instances where component names are incorrectly written with duplicated "Service" text (e.g., "Task Execution Service Service" instead of "Task Execution Service"). These need to be fixed across the documentation to maintain consistency with our naming conventions.

**Dependencies:**

* None

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] Find all instances of duplicated "Service Service" text using grep or similar tools
- [x] Fix each instance, ensuring correct component naming across all documentation
- [x] Update any related diagrams or visual representations if needed
- [x] Verify all links and references remain intact after changes
- [x] Run documentation validation to ensure no broken links

**Implementation Steps:**


1. Use grep to find all instances of "Service Service" text in documentation files
2. Create a list of files that need to be updated
3. For each file, review the context and fix the duplicated text
4. For any files with diagrams or visual representations, ensure they're updated accordingly
5. Test all links and references to ensure they still work correctly
6. Commit the changes with a descriptive message

**Notes:**
Initial grep search identified the following files containing "Service Service" duplication:

* task_execution_service/interfaces/task-execution-layer-api.yaml
* task_execution_service/interfaces/api.md
* task_execution_service/interfaces/internal.md
* testing_framework_service/interfaces/api.md
* task_execution_service/implementation files
* task_execution_service/data_model.md
* task_execution_service/operations files

All instances have been fixed using `sed` to replace "Service Service" with "Service" in all affected files.
