# System Components

This directory contains detailed documentation for each functional component of the system architecture. These components represent the services and engines that perform work in the system.

## Components

* [Event Processing Service](./event_processing_service/) - Handles event ingestion, routing, and triggering
* [Integration Service](./integration_service/) - Manages connections to external systems
* [Task Execution Service](./task_execution_service/) - Runs the actual work for each step
* [Web Application Service](./web_application_service/) - Generates dynamic interfaces based on component definitions
* [Validation Service](./validation_service/) - Enforces schema validation across the system
* [Workflow Orchestrator Service](./workflow_orchestrator_service/) - Manages workflow execution and state transitions
* [Testing Framework Service](./testing_framework_service/) - Provides testing capabilities for system components
* [Authentication Service](./auth_service/) - Provides centralized user authentication, authorization, and token management

## Component Documentation Structure

Each component directory follows a consistent documentation structure:


1. **README.md** - Entry point with navigation guidance
2. **overview.md** - High-level architectural overview
3. **data_model.md** - Core data structures and schemas
4. **implementation/** - Detailed implementation documentation
5. **interfaces/** - API documentation (public and internal)
6. **operations/** - Operational guidance (monitoring, scaling, configuration)
7. **examples/** - Practical usage examples

## Component Design Principles

Our system components follow these principles:


1. **Service-Oriented Architecture** - Each component is a standalone service with well-defined responsibilities
2. **Stateless Design** - Components store state in the database rather than in memory
3. **Event-Driven Communication** - Components communicate primarily through events
4. **Resilience** - Components are designed to recover from failures gracefully
5. **Scalability** - Components can be scaled horizontally to handle increased load
