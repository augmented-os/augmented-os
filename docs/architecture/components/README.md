# System Components

This directory contains detailed documentation for each functional component of the system architecture. These components represent the services and engines that perform work in the system.

## Components

- [Event Processing Service](./event_processing_service.md) - Handles event ingestion, routing, and triggering
- [Integration Service](./integration_service.md) - Manages connections to external systems
- [Task Execution Layer](./task_execution_layer.md) - Runs the actual work for each step
- [UI Rendering Engine](./ui_rendering_engine.md) - Generates dynamic interfaces based on component definitions
- [Validation Service](./validation_service.md) - Enforces schema validation across the system
- [Workflow Orchestrator Service](./workflow_orchestrator_service.md) - Manages workflow execution and state transitions

## Component Design Principles

Our system components follow these principles:

1. **Service-Oriented Architecture** - Each component is a standalone service with well-defined responsibilities
2. **Stateless Design** - Components store state in the database rather than in memory
3. **Event-Driven Communication** - Components communicate primarily through events
4. **Resilience** - Components are designed to recover from failures gracefully
5. **Scalability** - Components can be scaled horizontally to handle increased load

## Relationship to Data Schemas

Each system component interacts with one or more data schemas:

- **Event Processing Service** → Uses the [Events Schema](../schemas/events.md)
- **Task Execution Layer** → Uses the [Tasks Schema](../schemas/tasks.md)
- **Workflow Orchestrator Service** → Uses the [Workflows Schema](../schemas/workflows.md)
- **Integration Service** → Uses the [Integrations Schema](../schemas/integrations.md)
- **UI Rendering Engine** → Uses the [UI Components Schema](../schemas/ui_components.md)
- **Validation Service** → Uses all schemas for validation

For details on the data structures used by these components, see the [Data Schemas](../schemas/) documentation.

## Version Management

All component documentation is versioned through Git. Each document includes frontmatter with the last updated date, but no explicit version numbers as these are managed through Git commits, tags, and releases.
