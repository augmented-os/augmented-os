## User Scenarios

### Process Improvement Manager Scenario

Rachel, a Process Improvement Manager, is tasked with optimizing the company's order fulfillment process. She navigates to the Workflow Insights section and selects the "Order Fulfillment" workflow from the catalog. The system displays a performance overview showing key metrics including average completion time, success rate, and volume over the past month.

Rachel notices that the average completion time has been increasing steadily. She clicks on the trend line to drill down and sees a time series breakdown by workflow step. The visualization highlights a growing delay in the "Inventory Check" step. Using the Path Analyzer, she examines the execution paths and confirms that this step is consistently taking longer than expected.

Rachel switches to the Bottleneck Identification view, which automatically highlights the "Inventory Check" step and provides additional context: the integration with the inventory system is experiencing increasing latency during peak hours. The system suggests several optimization options, including implementing a caching mechanism for inventory data and scheduling non-urgent orders for processing during off-peak hours.

To validate her findings, Rachel compares the current workflow version with a previous version that performed better. The side-by-side comparison confirms that the integration changes made in the latest version are contributing to the performance issue. She exports her analysis as a report, including the system's optimization recommendations, and schedules a meeting with the development team to implement the improvements.

### Operations Analyst Scenario

Marcus, an Operations Analyst, is investigating a recent increase in customer complaints about delayed service activations. He opens the Workflow Insights dashboard and filters for the "Service Activation" workflow, focusing on the past two weeks when complaints increased.

The Success Rate Analytics immediately shows a drop in successful completions from 98% to 85%. Marcus uses the Failure Analysis tool to examine the unsuccessful workflows and discovers that most failures are occurring at the "Account Verification" step. The Error Pattern Detection feature identifies a common error message related to a third-party identity verification service.

Marcus switches to the Resource Analysis view to check the integration load and sees that the identity verification service is experiencing timeout errors during high-volume periods. The system's recommendation engine suggests implementing a retry mechanism with exponential backoff and potentially upgrading the service tier with the third-party provider.

To understand the business impact, Marcus uses the Outcome Analysis tools to correlate the workflow failures with customer satisfaction metrics and support ticket volume. The analysis confirms a direct relationship between the verification failures and negative customer feedback. Based on this comprehensive analysis, Marcus prepares a business case for implementing the recommended changes, including cost estimates and projected improvement in customer satisfaction.
