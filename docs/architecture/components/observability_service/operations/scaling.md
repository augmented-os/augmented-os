# Scaling Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides guidance on scaling the Observability Service to handle increased load, maintain performance, and ensure reliability. It covers horizontal and vertical scaling strategies, resource requirements, and performance characteristics under different load conditions.

## Resource Requirements

### Base Requirements

The Observability Service has the following base resource requirements per instance:

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------------|-------|
| CPU | 2 cores | 4 cores | CPU-intensive during query operations and alert evaluation |
| Memory | 4 GB | 8 GB | Memory usage increases with collection buffer size and query complexity |
| Disk | 20 GB | 50 GB | SSD recommended for local buffer storage; primary storage is external |
| Network | 100 Mbps | 1 Gbps | High network utilization for data collection and storage operations |

### Scaling Factors

The following factors influence resource requirements:

| Factor | Impact | Scaling Recommendation |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| Number of monitored services | Linear increase in collection load | Add 0.5 CPU core and 1 GB memory per 10 additional services |
| Data ingestion rate | Direct impact on collection and storage components | Scale horizontally for high ingestion rates (>10K events/sec) |
| Query complexity and frequency | CPU and memory spikes during query execution | Increase CPU and memory for query-intensive workloads |
| Alert rule count and evaluation frequency | Increases CPU usage during evaluation cycles | Add CPU resources for workloads with >100 alert rules or frequent evaluation |
| Retention period | Impacts storage requirements, not service resources | Scale storage backends independently |

## Performance Characteristics

### Throughput

The Observability Service has been tested with the following throughput characteristics:

| Configuration | Operations/Second | Latency (P95) | Resource Utilization |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| 1 instance, 2 CPU, 4 GB RAM | 5,000 logs/sec, 10,000 metrics/sec, 500 traces/sec | 150ms | CPU: 75%, Memory: 70% |
| 3 instances, 4 CPU, 8 GB RAM | 15,000 logs/sec, 30,000 metrics/sec, 1,500 traces/sec | 180ms | CPU: 65%, Memory: 60% |
| 5 instances, 4 CPU, 8 GB RAM | 25,000 logs/sec, 50,000 metrics/sec, 2,500 traces/sec | 200ms | CPU: 70%, Memory: 65% |

### Bottlenecks

The following bottlenecks have been identified:

| Bottleneck | Symptoms | Mitigation |
|------------|----------|------------|
| Storage write throughput | Increasing collection buffer utilization, elevated ingestion latency | Scale storage backend, implement write sharding, increase buffer size |
| Query concurrency | High query latency, query timeouts, high CPU usage | Implement query quotas, optimize queries, increase query engine resources |
| Alert evaluation | Delayed alert notifications, high CPU usage during evaluation | Optimize alert queries, stagger alert evaluations, reduce evaluation frequency |
| Network bandwidth | Packet loss, increased latency | Increase network capacity, implement compression, batch smaller payloads |

## Horizontal Scaling

The Observability Service is designed to scale horizontally by adding more instances.

### Scaling Strategy

1. **Instance Sizing**: Each instance should be provisioned with 4 CPU cores and 8 GB of memory
2. **Load Balancing**: Requests should be distributed using a consistent hash-based load balancing to ensure related data goes to the same instance
3. **Scaling Triggers**: Add instances when:
   * CPU utilization exceeds 70% for 10 minutes
   * Memory utilization exceeds 75% for 10 minutes
   * Collection buffer utilization exceeds 60% for 5 minutes
   * P95 ingestion latency exceeds 200ms for 5 minutes
4. **Maximum Instances**: The service has been tested with up to 10 instances per deployment

### Stateful Considerations

The Observability Service maintains the following state that must be considered when scaling:

| State Type | Storage | Scaling Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|---------|----------------|------------|
| Collection Buffers | In-memory | New instances start with empty buffers | Implement gradual request routing to new instances |
| Alert State | External database | Minimal impact | Maintain single source of truth in database |
| Query Cache | In-memory | Cache misses on new instances | Implement distributed caching or accept initial performance impact |
| Rate Limit Counters | In-memory | Client may exceed global limits | Implement distributed rate limiting or centralized tracking |

## Vertical Scaling

While horizontal scaling is preferred, vertical scaling can be used in the following scenarios:

| Scenario | Vertical Scaling Approach | Limitations |
|----------|---------------------------|------------|
| Short-term traffic spikes | Increase CPU and memory temporarily | Limited by host capacity, no redundancy improvements |
| Query-heavy workloads | Increase CPU and memory for better query performance | Limited by single instance performance |
| Single client with high volume | Increase resources on dedicated instance | Not cost-effective for long-term growth |

### Resource Allocation Guidelines

When vertically scaling, prioritize resources in this order:

1. **Memory**: Increase when buffer utilization is high or for complex queries
2. **CPU**: Increase when query latency is high or alert evaluation takes too long
3. **Network**: Increase when handling high data volumes or many concurrent clients
4. **Disk**: Increase for larger local buffers and temporary storage

## Storage Scaling

The Observability Service interacts with storage backends that require their own scaling considerations:

| Storage Type | Scaling Strategy | Connection Pool Sizing | Indexing Recommendations |
|----------|------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Logs (Elasticsearch) | Scale horizontally with time-based indices | 20 connections per service instance | Index by timestamp, service, and log level |
| Metrics (Prometheus/TimescaleDB) | Scale with time-based partitioning | 10 connections per service instance | Index by metric name, timestamp, and key tags |
| Traces (Jaeger/OpenTelemetry) | Scale with service-based sharding | 10 connections per service instance | Index by traceId, service, and timestamp |
| Alerts (PostgreSQL) | Master-replica setup | 5 connections per service instance | Index by rule ID, status, and evaluation time |

## Caching Strategy

The Observability Service uses caching to improve performance:

| Cache Type | Purpose | Sizing Guidelines | Eviction Policy |
|------------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Query Result Cache | Reduce repeat queries on same data | 10% of instance memory, max 1GB | LRU with 5-minute TTL |
| Metadata Cache | Frequently accessed metadata like alert rules | 256MB per instance | LRU with 1-minute TTL |
| Auth Token Cache | Reduce authentication service load | 128MB per instance | LRU with token expiration time |
| Storage Schema Cache | Optimize storage operations | 128MB per instance | LRU with 10-minute TTL |

## Regional Deployment

For multi-region deployments, consider the following:

| Aspect | Recommendation | Rationale |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Data Replication | Local storage with selective replication | Reduces cross-region traffic, maintains data locality |
| Request Routing | Route to local region, fail over to others | Minimizes latency for data collection |
| Cross-Region Queries | Federated queries across regional deployments | Enables global visibility while maintaining regional storage |
| Alert Management | Primary-secondary setup with automatic failover | Prevents duplicate alerts while ensuring availability |

## Load Testing Results
