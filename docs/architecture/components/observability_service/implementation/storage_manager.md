# Storage Manager

## Overview

The Storage Manager is a core component of the Observability Service responsible for efficiently storing, organizing, and managing observability data across its lifecycle. It handles the complexity of different storage requirements for logs, metrics, and traces while providing a unified interface for data persistence and retrieval.

## Key Responsibilities

* Managing connections to various storage backends
* Implementing data partitioning and sharding strategies
* Enforcing data retention and lifecycle policies
* Coordinating read and write operations across storage tiers
* Optimizing storage performance and cost efficiency
* Ensuring data durability and integrity
* Handling backup and recovery operations

## Implementation Approach

The Storage Manager system follows these design principles:

1. **Backend Abstraction** - Abstract storage implementation details behind a common interface to support multiple backends
2. **Data Lifecycle Management** - Automatically manage data movement between hot, warm, and cold storage tiers
3. **Separation of Concerns** - Isolate storage-specific logic from data processing and querying logic
4. **Configurable Retention** - Support flexible data retention policies based on age, volume, and importance
5. **Graceful Degradation** - Implement fallback mechanisms when primary storage is unavailable or degraded

## Implementation Details

### Storage Backend Abstraction

The Storage Manager provides a pluggable architecture to support different storage backends for different data types:

```typescript
// Storage backend interface
interface StorageBackend<T> {
  write(data: T[], options?: WriteOptions): Promise<WriteResult>;
  read(query: Query, options?: ReadOptions): Promise<ReadResult<T>>;
  delete(query: Query): Promise<DeleteResult>;
  status(): Promise<BackendStatus>;
}

// Concrete implementations
class ElasticsearchLogStorage implements StorageBackend<LogEntry> {
  // Implementation for Elasticsearch
}

class PrometheusMetricStorage implements StorageBackend<MetricDataPoint> {
  // Implementation for Prometheus TSDB
}

class PostgresTraceStorage implements StorageBackend<TraceSpan> {
  // Implementation for PostgreSQL
}
```

The Storage Manager selects the appropriate backend based on data type and configuration:

* **Logs**: Primary: Elasticsearch, Alternative: PostgreSQL
* **Metrics**: Primary: Prometheus TSDB, Alternative: InfluxDB or TimescaleDB
* **Traces**: Primary: Jaeger storage, Alternative: PostgreSQL
* **Alerts and Dashboards**: PostgreSQL

### Data Partitioning and Sharding

Data is partitioned based on several strategies to optimize query performance:

1. **Time-based Partitioning**: Data is primarily partitioned by time period
   * Logs: Daily partitions
   * Metrics: Hourly partitions for recent data, daily for older data
   * Traces: Daily partitions

2. **Service-based Sharding**: For multi-tenant deployments, data can be sharded by service
   * Separate physical indices or tables for high-volume services
   * Logical separation using partition fields for other services

3. **Custom Partitioning**: Additional partitioning based on configurable fields
   * Environment (production, staging, development)
   * Region or data center
   * Tenant or organization ID

### Data Lifecycle Management

The Storage Manager implements a tiered storage approach:

1. **Hot Storage**
   * Recent data (typically 1-7 days)
   * Optimized for fast queries and indexing
   * Usually SSD-backed for performance
   * Full indexing and real-time query capabilities

2. **Warm Storage**
   * Intermediate data (typically 7-30 days)
   * Balances query performance and cost
   * May use HDD storage with SSD caching
   * Reduced indexing but still queryable

3. **Cold Storage**
   * Historical data (30+ days)
   * Optimized for cost efficiency
   * Uses object storage or compressed archives
   * Limited query capabilities, may require restoration

Data movement between tiers happens automatically based on configurable policies.

### Edge Cases and Error Handling

The implementation addresses the following edge cases:

| Scenario | Handling Approach |
|----|----|
| Storage backend failure | Automatic failover to secondary backend with transparent retry |
| Write throughput spikes | Dynamic buffering and throttling to prevent overwhelming storage |
| Storage capacity exhaustion | Automated emergency retention policy enforcement and alerts |
| Corrupted indices | Automatic index health checks and repair procedures |
| Cross-region replication failures | Conflict resolution with version tracking and reconciliation |
| Schema evolution | Schema versioning with backward compatibility for older data |

## Performance Considerations

The Storage Manager includes several optimizations:

* **Write Optimization**
  * Bulk write operations to reduce overhead
  * Asynchronous indexing for non-critical fields
  * Compression for storage efficiency
  * Write-ahead logging for durability

* **Read Optimization**
  * Query result caching for common queries
  * Materialized views for frequent aggregation queries
  * Index optimization for common query patterns
  * Partition pruning to limit scan scope
