# Observability Service Documentation

## Structure Overview

This documentation covers the Observability Service, which provides centralized logging, metrics, and tracing capabilities across the Augmented OS platform. The documentation is organized as follows:

### High-Level Documentation

* [Overview](./overview.md): High-level architectural overview
* [Data Model](./data_model.md): Core data structures and schemas

### Detailed Implementation

The `implementation/` directory contains detailed documentation on specific aspects of the Observability Service:

* [Data Collection](./implementation/data_collection.md): How observability data is collected and ingested
* [Storage Manager](./implementation/storage_manager.md): How data is stored and managed
* [Query Engine](./implementation/query_engine.md): How data is queried and analyzed
* [Alert Manager](./implementation/alert_manager.md): How alerts are defined and triggered

### Interfaces

The `interfaces/` directory documents the service's public and internal APIs:

* [API Reference](./interfaces/api.md): Public APIs
* [Internal Interfaces](./interfaces/internal.md): Internal communication

### Operations

The `operations/` directory covers operational aspects:

* [Monitoring](./operations/monitoring.md): Monitoring guidelines
* [Scaling](./operations/scaling.md): Scaling considerations
* [Configuration](./operations/configuration.md): Configuration options

### Examples

The `examples/` directory provides practical usage examples:

* [Basic Example](./examples/basic_example.md): Simple logging and metrics integration
* [Advanced Example](./examples/advanced_example.md): Complex observability patterns
* [Service Integration](./examples/service_integration.md): How services integrate with observability
