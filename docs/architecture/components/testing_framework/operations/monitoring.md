# Testing Framework Monitoring

This document outlines the monitoring strategies, metrics, and alerts for the Testing Framework component.

## Overview

Effective monitoring of the Testing Framework is critical to ensure:
- Test executions are proceeding as expected
- System performance is maintained
- Resource utilization is optimized
- Early detection of potential issues
- Analysis of testing trends

| `test_suite_success_rate` | Percentage of successful test suite executions | <90% | Warning, <70% Critical |

## Monitoring Dashboards

The following dashboards should be created for monitoring the Testing Framework:

1. **Test Execution Overview**
   - Real-time view of test executions
   - Success/failure rates
   - Execution durations
   - Queue depths

2. **System Health**
   - CPU, memory, disk, and network usage
   - Database performance
   - API performance

3. **Test Definition Analytics**
   - Test definition growth trends
   - Most frequently executed tests
   - Most frequently failing tests

4. **Test Suite Analytics**
   - Test suite execution trends
   - Success/failure rates by test suite
   - Duration trends by test suite

## Alerting Strategy

### Alert Priorities

| Priority | Response Time | Notification Channels | Description |
|----------|---------------|------------------------|-------------|
| P1 (Critical) | Immediate (24/7) | PagerDuty, SMS, Email | Service is down or severely degraded |
| P2 (High) | <30 minutes (business hours) | PagerDuty, Email | Significant impact to service quality |
| P3 (Medium) | <2 hours (business hours) | Email, Slack | Minor impact to service quality |
| P4 (Low) | Next business day | Slack, Ticket | No immediate impact, requires attention |

### Alert Grouping

Alerts should be grouped by:
- Component (Test Definition Service, Test Execution Engine, etc.)
- Environment (Development, Staging, Production)
- Test Type (Workflow, Task, Integration, etc.)

### Alert Suppression

To prevent alert fatigue:
- Correlate related alerts
- Implement dynamic thresholds based on baseline performance
- Use alert dampening for transient issues
- Implement automatic resolution for self-healing issues

## Log Monitoring

Key log patterns to monitor:

| Log Pattern | Description | Alert Severity |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| `FATAL` | Fatal errors that cause service disruption | Critical |
| `ERROR` | Errors that affect functionality but don't crash the service | Warning |
| `Test execution timeout` | Test execution exceeded the maximum allowed time | Warning |
| `Database connection failure` | Failed to connect to the database | Critical |
| `Queue processing error` | Error processing the test execution queue | Warning |
| `Authentication failure` | Failed authentication attempts | Warning (if > 10/min) |

## Monitoring Implementation

### Prometheus Metrics

Example Prometheus metrics configuration:

```yaml
metrics:
  - name: test_execution_rate
    type: counter
    help: "Number of test executions per minute"
    labels: [test_type, environment]
  - name: test_execution_duration
    type: histogram
    help: "Duration of test executions in seconds"
    buckets: [0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 30.0, 60.0, 120.0, 300.0, 600.0]
    labels: [test_type, environment, test_id]
  - name: test_execution_status
    type: counter
    help: "Status of test executions"
    labels: [test_type, environment, status]
```

### Grafana Dashboard Examples

Example queries for Grafana dashboards:

```
# Test Execution Success Rate
sum(rate(test_execution_status{status="success"}[5m])) / sum(rate(test_execution_status[5m])) * 100

# 95th Percentile Test Execution Duration
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(test_execution_duration_bucket[5m])) by (le, test_type))

# Test Execution Queue Depth
test_execution_queue_depth
```

## Health Check Endpoints

The Testing Framework exposes the following health check endpoints:

- `/health/liveness`: Simple check to confirm the service is running
- `/health/readiness`: Check to confirm the service is ready to accept requests
- `/health/dependencies`: Check the status of all dependencies (database, message queue, etc.)
- `/metrics`: Prometheus metrics endpoint

## Performance Benchmarks

Baseline performance benchmarks for the Testing Framework:

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| API Response Time (p95) | <500ms |
| Test Execution Startup Time | <2s |
| Database Query Time (p95) | <100ms |
| Maximum Concurrent Test Executions | 100 |
| Test Results Storage Rate | >100 results/second |
| Test Definition Retrieval Time | <50ms |

## Maintenance Procedures

Regular maintenance tasks for the Testing Framework monitoring:

1. Review and update alert thresholds quarterly
2. Validate monitoring coverage for new features
3. Review and clean up old test results data
4. Optimize database indices based on query patterns
5. Update baseline performance metrics
