# Validation Service Documentation Migration Verification Report

This document tracks the migration process from the original validation_service.md to the new standardized component documentation structure.

## Migration Status

- [x] README.md - Created following template structure
- [x] overview.md - Contains all required sections and the ASCII architecture diagram
- [x] data_model.md - Includes proper schema definitions
- [x] Implementation documents correctly migrated:
  - [x] schema_registry.md
  - [x] validation_engine.md 
  - [x] custom_validator_registry.md
  - [x] error_formatter.md
- [x] API documentation standardized:
  - [x] interfaces/api.md
  - [x] interfaces/internal.md
  - [x] OpenAPI specification created (validation-service-api.yaml)
- [x] Operations documents created with all required sections:
  - [x] monitoring.md
  - [x] scaling.md
  - [x] configuration.md
  - [x] deployment.md
- [x] Example documents created:
  - [x] basic_example.md
  - [x] advanced_example.md

## Verification Checklist

- [x] All content from original validation_service.md migrated
- [x] All TODOs in the original documentation addressed and resolved
- [x] Code examples preserved with proper syntax highlighting
- [x] Internal links updated to match the new structure
- [x] API documentation standardized with proper endpoint documentation
- [x] Cross-references between documents verified
- [ ] Final consistency check performed across all documents
- [ ] Peer review conducted

## Outstanding Items

1. Need to complete final consistency check across all documents
2. Need to perform peer review of migrated documentation
3. Update any cross-component links to reference the new structure

## Notes

- The schema evolution and compatibility checking functionality has been thoroughly documented in both the implementation section and the examples
- All diagrams have been preserved and formatted according to standards
- All code examples have been checked for accuracy and consistent formatting
