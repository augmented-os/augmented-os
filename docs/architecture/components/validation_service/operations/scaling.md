# Validation Service Scaling

This document provides guidance on scaling the Validation Service to meet performance and availability requirements in various deployment scenarios.

## Resource Requirements

### Baseline Requirements

The Validation Service has the following baseline resource requirements for a standard deployment:

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended | High-Performance |
|----------|---------|-------------|------------------|
| CPU | 2 vCPU | 4 vCPU | 8+ vCPU |
| Memory | 4 GB | 8 GB | 16+ GB |
| Disk | 20 GB | 50 GB | 100+ GB |
| Network | 100 Mbps | 1 Gbps | 10+ Gbps |

### Component-Specific Requirements

| Component | CPU Usage | Memory Usage | Scaling Notes |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Schema Registry | Medium | High | Memory-intensive due to schema caching |
| Validation Engine | High | Medium | CPU-bound for complex validations |
| Custom Validator Registry | Variable | Medium | Depends on custom validator complexity |
| API Layer | Low | Low | Network I/O bound |
| Database | Medium | High | Scales with schema count and complexity |

## Scaling Factors

The Validation Service's resource needs scale primarily based on these factors:

| Factor | Impact | Scaling Strategy |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Validation Request Rate | Linear increase in CPU usage | Horizontal scaling |
| Schema Count | Increases memory usage, schema lookup time | Larger instance size, improved caching |
| Schema Complexity | Increases validation time and CPU usage | More CPU cores, optimization |
| Custom Validator Count | Increases memory usage | Larger instance size |
| Custom Validator Complexity | Increases CPU usage | More CPU cores, validator optimization |
| Concurrent Users | Increases overall resource usage | Horizontal scaling |

## Throughput Characteristics

### Performance Benchmarks

The following benchmarks provide guidance on expected throughput:

| Configuration | Simple Validation | Complex Validation | Custom Validator |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 2 vCPU, 4 GB | ~2,000 req/sec | ~500 req/sec | ~200 req/sec |
| 4 vCPU, 8 GB | ~5,000 req/sec | ~1,200 req/sec | ~500 req/sec |
| 8 vCPU, 16 GB | ~10,000 req/sec | ~2,500 req/sec | ~1,000 req/sec |

*Note: These figures assume optimized configurations with adequate caching.*

### Latency Characteristics

| Operation | Avg. Latency | P95 Latency | Scaling Impact |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Simple Schema Validation | 5-10ms | 20-30ms | Minimal increase with load |
| Complex Schema Validation | 20-50ms | 100-150ms | Increases with schema complexity |
| Custom Validator Execution | 30-100ms | 200-500ms | Increases significantly with complexity |
| Schema Registration | 50-100ms | 200-300ms | Minimal increase with load |
| Schema Lookup (cached) | 1-2ms | 5-10ms | Minimal increase with load |
| Schema Lookup (uncached) | 10-30ms | 50-100ms | Increases with schema count |

## Bottlenecks & Mitigation

| Bottleneck | Symptoms | Mitigation Strategy |
|------------|----------|---------------------|
| CPU Saturation | High CPU usage, increased latency | Horizontal scaling, optimize validators |
| Memory Exhaustion | High memory usage, GC pressure | Increase memory, tune caching |
| Database Contention | High DB query times, timeouts | Read replicas, connection pooling |
| Network Saturation | High network utilization, timeouts | Network optimization, data locality |
| Custom Validator Performance | High validator execution times | Optimize validators, caching |
| Schema Cache Misses | High schema lookup times | Increase cache size, preload common schemas |

## Horizontal Scaling

The Validation Service is designed for horizontal scaling with stateless service instances.

### Scaling Patterns

| Deployment Size | Instance Count | Load Balancer | Notes |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| Small | 2-3 | Simple round-robin | Suitable for development/testing |
| Medium | 3-6 | Layer 7 with sticky sessions | Suitable for most production workloads |
| Large | 6-12 | Global load balancing with health checks | For high-volume production |
| Enterprise | 12+ | Multi-region with auto-scaling | For global, mission-critical deployments |

### Auto-Scaling Configuration

The Validation Service can be configured for auto-scaling based on these metrics:

| Metric | Scale Out Threshold | Scale In Threshold | Cooldown Period |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| CPU Utilization | >70% for 3 minutes | <50% for 10 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Memory Utilization | >75% for 3 minutes | <60% for 10 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Request Rate | >1000 req/sec per instance | <500 req/sec per instance | 10 minutes |
| Latency | P95 >300ms for 3 minutes | P95 <100ms for 10 minutes | 5 minutes |

### Scaling Recommendations

1. **Start Small**: Begin with 3 instances for high availability
2. **Monitor Usage**: Track CPU, memory, and latency metrics
3. **Gradual Scaling**: Add instances incrementally (25-50% at a time)
4. **Test Scaling**: Regularly test scaling behavior with load testing
5. **Regional Distribution**: Deploy instances across availability zones
6. **Reserve Capacity**: Maintain 30% headroom for traffic spikes

## Vertical Scaling

While horizontal scaling is preferred, vertical scaling can help with specific workloads:

| Scenario | Vertical Scaling Approach | Benefits | Limitations |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|-------------|
| Many complex schemas | Increase memory | Larger cache capacity | Limited by physical server capacity |
| CPU-intensive validation | Increase CPU cores | Faster complex validations | Diminishing returns beyond 16-32 cores |
| Custom validator-heavy | Balanced CPU/memory increase | Better validator performance | May be more cost-effective to optimize validators |
| I/O-bound operations | SSD/NVMe storage, network optimization | Faster database operations | Limited by technology limitations |

## Database Scaling

The Validation Service database can be scaled using these approaches:

| Approach | When to Use | Considerations |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Read Replicas | High read/low write workloads | Eventual consistency for schema data |
| Sharding | Very large schema collections | Added complexity for schema lookups |
| Caching Layer | Frequent access to popular schemas | Cache invalidation complexity |
| In-Memory Database | Ultra-low latency requirements | Higher cost, data persistence concerns |

## Caching Strategy

Effective caching is critical for Validation Service performance:

| Cache Type | Size Recommendation | TTL | Eviction Policy |
|------------|---------------------|-----|-----------------|
| Schema Cache | 25% of total schemas or min 1GB | 1 hour | LRU |
| Compiled Schema Cache | 10% of total schemas or min 500MB | 2 hours | LRU |
| Validator Cache | All validators or min 250MB | 30 minutes | LRU |
| Validation Result Cache | Based on duplication rate | 5-15 minutes | LRU |

## Regional Deployment

For multi-region deployments:

| Region Type | Purpose | Synchronization |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| Primary | Write operations, schema management | N/A |
| Secondary | Read operations, validation | Async replication from primary |
| DR | Disaster recovery | Async replication from primary |

## Load Testing Results

Recent load tests demonstrate these scaling characteristics:

| Test Scenario | Configuration | Max Throughput | Latency at 50% Load | Latency at 80% Load |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Simple validations only | 3 x 4 vCPU, 8GB | 12,500 req/sec | 15ms | 45ms |
| Mixed workload | 6 x 4 vCPU, 8GB | 8,200 req/sec | 35ms | 85ms |
| Complex validations | 6 x 8 vCPU, 16GB | 5,400 req/sec | 75ms | 150ms |
| Custom validators | 6 x 8 vCPU, 16GB | 3,800 req/sec | 95ms | 180ms |
