# Advanced Event Processing Service Examples

## Overview

This section provides advanced examples for the Event Processing Service, focusing on complex event processing scenarios, workflow triggers, and integration patterns. These examples demonstrate sophisticated use cases that leverage the full capabilities of the Event Processing Service.

The examples build upon the basic concepts covered in the [Basic Examples](../basic_example.md) document and are intended for developers who are already familiar with the fundamentals of the Event Processing Service.

## Prerequisites

Before working with these advanced examples, ensure you have:


1. A good understanding of event-driven architecture principles
2. The Event Processing Service deployed and configured
3. Completed the [Basic Examples](../basic_example.md) to understand fundamental concepts
4. Required client libraries installed:

   ```bash
   # Node.js client with advanced features
   npm install @example/event-service-client@latest
   
   # Optional: Event processing utilities
   npm install @example/event-processing-utils
   ```
5. Access to a workflow orchestration system for workflow trigger examples
6. Development tools for testing and debugging event flows
