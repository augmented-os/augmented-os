# Event Processing Service

## Overview

The Event Processing Service is responsible for handling all events within the system. It acts as a central hub for event reception, routing, and delivery, enabling loose coupling between components and supporting event-driven architecture patterns.

## Key Responsibilities

* Receiving events from internal and external sources
* Managing event definitions for the entire system
* Validating events against defined schemas
* Routing events to appropriate subscribers
* Persisting events for audit and replay
* Supporting event filtering and transformation
* Enabling event-driven workflow triggers
* Providing event correlation and tracing
* Exposing event definitions for UI builders and integrations

## Core Components

* **Event Receiver**: Handles event ingestion from multiple sources, validates event schemas, and normalizes event formats
* **Event Router**: Routes events to appropriate subscribers based on subscription patterns and filtering rules
* **Event Store**: Provides persistent storage for events, enabling replay, audit, and event sourcing capabilities
* **Event Processor**: Handles event transformation, correlation, and custom processing logic
* **Workflow Event Triggers**: Manages relationships between events and workflow definitions, determining when workflows should be triggered
* **Internal Event Queue**: Manages internal event flow between components to ensure reliable processing

## Service Interfaces

The service exposes the following primary interfaces:

* **Event Publishing API**: Allows services to publish events to the event processing system
* **Event Subscription API**: Enables services to subscribe to events based on patterns and filters
* **Event Definition API**: Provides CRUD operations for managing event definitions
* **Workflow Trigger API**: Allows configuration of relationships between events and workflows
* **Event Query API**: Enables querying historical events for replay and analysis
