# Event Processing Service Documentation

## Structure Overview

This documentation covers the Event Processing Service, which is responsible for handling all events within the system, acting as a central hub for event reception, routing, and delivery. The documentation is organized as follows:

### High-Level Documentation

* [Overview](./overview.md): High-level architectural overview
* [Data Model](./data_model.md): Core data structures and schemas

### Detailed Implementation

The `implementation/` directory contains detailed documentation on specific aspects of the Event Processing Service:

* [Event Receiver](./implementation/event_receiver.md): Event ingestion and validation
* [Event Router](./implementation/event_router.md): Event routing and subscription management
* [Event Store](./implementation/event_store.md): Persistent storage for events
* [Event Processor](./implementation/event_processor.md): Processing and transformation of events
* [Workflow Resumption](./implementation/workflow_resumption.md): Support for resuming workflows
* [Internal Event Queue](./implementation/internal_queue.md): Internal event handling mechanisms
* [Trigger Registry](./implementation/trigger_registry.md): Managing workflow event triggers

### Interfaces

The `interfaces/` directory documents the service's public and internal APIs:

* [API Reference](./interfaces/api.md): Public APIs
* [Internal Interfaces](./interfaces/internal.md): Internal communication

### Operations

The `operations/` directory covers operational aspects:

* [Monitoring](./operations/monitoring.md): Monitoring guidelines
* [Scaling](./operations/scaling.md): Scaling considerations
* [Configuration](./operations/configuration.md): Configuration options

### Examples

The `examples/` directory provides practical usage examples:

* [Basic Example](./examples/basic_example.md): Simple event publishing and subscription
* [Advanced Example](./examples/advanced_example.md): Complex event processing and workflow triggers

## How to Use This Documentation

1. **New to the system?** Start with the [Overview](./overview.md) for a high-level understanding
2. **Implementing event-driven features?** Check the [Examples](./examples/) directory
3. **Debugging event issues?** See [Event Processor](./implementation/event_processor.md) and [Monitoring](./operations/monitoring.md)
4. **Optimizing event performance?** Review [Scaling](./operations/scaling.md) and [Event Store](./implementation/event_store.md)
