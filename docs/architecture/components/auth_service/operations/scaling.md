# Scaling Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides guidance on scaling the Authentication Service to handle increased load, maintain performance, and ensure reliability. It covers horizontal and vertical scaling strategies, resource requirements, and performance characteristics under different load conditions, while emphasizing the security considerations specific to authentication infrastructure.

## Resource Requirements

### Base Requirements

The Authentication Service has the following base resource requirements per instance:

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------------|-------|
| CPU | 2 cores | 4 cores | CPU-intensive during authentication and token validation |
| Memory | 2 GB | 4 GB | Increases with active sessions and token cache size |
| Disk | 10 GB | 20 GB | SSD recommended for key storage and token database |
| Network | 100 Mbps | 1 Gbps | Higher bandwidth needed for burst authentication periods |

### Scaling Factors

The following factors influence resource requirements:

| Factor | Impact | Scaling Recommendation |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| Active users | Each 10,000 active users require approximately 1GB additional memory | Scale horizontally and increase memory as user base grows |
| Authentication rate | High authentication rates require more CPU | Scale based on P95 CPU utilization, add instances when exceeding 70% |
| MFA usage | MFA verification increases CPU and external service dependencies | Scale based on MFA verification latency metrics |
| Token validation volume | High validation rates increase CPU usage | Cache public keys and scale horizontally for token validation |
| Key rotation frequency | More frequent rotations impact CPU periodically | Schedule rotations during low-usage periods |

## Performance Characteristics

### Throughput

The Authentication Service has been tested with the following throughput characteristics:

| Configuration | Operations/Second | Latency (P95) | Resource Utilization |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| 2 instances, 2 CPU, 2 GB RAM | 100 auth/s, 1,000 validations/s | Auth: 250ms, Validation: 5ms | CPU: 60%, Memory: 70% |
| 4 instances, 2 CPU, 2 GB RAM | 200 auth/s, 2,000 validations/s | Auth: 275ms, Validation: 6ms | CPU: 65%, Memory: 75% |
| 4 instances, 4 CPU, 4 GB RAM | 400 auth/s, 4,000 validations/s | Auth: 200ms, Validation: 3ms | CPU: 50%, Memory: 60% |

### Bottlenecks

The following bottlenecks have been identified:

| Bottleneck | Symptoms | Mitigation |
|------------|----------|------------|
| Database connections | Increased authentication latency, connection errors | Optimize connection pooling, consider read replicas |
| Key signing operations | Increased token issuance latency | Use hardware acceleration, HSM offloading, or caching |
| MFA verification | Increased end-to-end authentication time | Cache MFA status, optimize external provider integration |
| JWKS endpoint load | High latency for token validation | Implement CDN caching for JWKS endpoint, longer key validity |
| Password hashing | High CPU during authentication peaks | Adjust work factor based on hardware, implement queue for peak periods |

## Horizontal Scaling

The Authentication Service is designed to scale horizontally by adding more instances.

### Scaling Strategy

1. **Instance Sizing**: Each instance should be provisioned with 2-4 CPU cores and 2-4 GB of memory
2. **Load Balancing**: Requests should be distributed using round-robin or least connections strategy
3. **Scaling Triggers**: Add instances when CPU utilization exceeds 70% for more than 5 minutes
4. **Maximum Instances**: The service has been tested with up to 20 instances

### Stateful Considerations

The Authentication Service maintains the following state that must be considered when scaling:

| State Type | Storage | Scaling Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|---------|----------------|------------|
| Session information | Database | Read-heavy, affects verification | Implement read replicas, caching |
| Cryptographic keys | Secure storage | Must be available to all instances | Use centralized key store or synchronize |
| Token blacklist | Shared cache | High-write during logouts | Use distributed cache with low latency |
| Rate limiting counters | Distributed cache | Consistency needed across instances | Use central rate limiting service |

## Vertical Scaling

While horizontal scaling is preferred, vertical scaling can be used in the following scenarios:

| Scenario | Vertical Scaling Approach | Limitations |
|----------|---------------------------|------------|
| Key generation/rotation | Increase CPU for instances handling key operations | Limited benefit beyond 8 cores |
| Memory pressure from caching | Increase memory allocation | Benefits taper off beyond 8GB for most deployments |
| Database on same host | Separate database to dedicated infrastructure | Not recommended for production |

### Resource Allocation Guidelines

When vertically scaling, prioritize resources in this order:

1. **CPU**: Increase when authentication or token validation latency increases
2. **Memory**: Increase when cache hit rates decrease or OOM events occur
3. **Disk I/O**: Increase when database operations show high I/O wait times
4. **Network**: Increase when network saturation affects external service calls

## Database Scaling

The Authentication Service interacts with databases that require their own scaling considerations:

| Database | Scaling Strategy | Connection Pool Sizing | Indexing Recommendations |
|----------|------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| User Store | Read replicas with primary for writes | max_connections = (num_instances * 10) + 20 | Index on username, email, external IDs |
| Token Store | Sharding by user ID | max_connections = (num_instances * 5) + 10 | Index on token ID, user ID, expiration |
| Audit Logs | Consider time-series DB, partitioning | max_connections = (num_instances * 3) + 5 | Index on timestamp, user ID, event type |

## Caching Strategy

The Authentication Service uses caching to improve performance:

| Cache Type | Purpose | Sizing Guidelines | Eviction Policy |
|------------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Public Key Cache | JWKS caching for token validation | 100MB base + 10MB per signing key | Time-based (1 hour) |
| User Profile Cache | Reduce DB load on frequent auth | 10MB per 1,000 active users | LRU with 15-minute TTL |
| Session Cache | Quick validation of session state | 5MB per 1,000 active sessions | Time-based with session expiry |
| Token Blacklist | Track revoked tokens | Size based on token volume | Time-based with token expiry |

## Regional Deployment

For multi-region deployments, consider the following:

| Aspect | Recommendation | Rationale |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Data Replication | Asynchronous replication with local write | Minimize authentication latency |
| Key Management | Primary-replica with region-local caching | Ensure consistent key material |
| Request Routing | Geographic routing to nearest region | Minimize latency for users |
| Failover Strategy | Automatic failover with DNS updates | Maintain service during region outage |

## Load Testing Results

The following load tests have been conducted:

### Steady Load Test

* **Duration**: 24 hours
* **Request Rate**: 100 authentications/second, 1,000 token validations/second
* **Results**: P95 latency remained under 250ms for authentication, 5ms for validation

### Spike Test

* **Baseline**: 50 authentications/second
* **Spike**: 500 authentications/second for 5 minutes
* **Results**: P95 latency increased to 500ms during spike, no failures

### Endurance Test

* **Duration**: 7 days
* **Request Rate**: Varying from 10-200 authentications/second following daily patterns
* **Results**: No memory leaks detected, consistent performance throughout test

## Security Scaling Considerations

When scaling the Authentication Service, maintain these security considerations:

1. **Key Rotation**: Ensure key rotation procedures work correctly across all instances
2. **Rate Limiting**: Maintain consistent rate limiting across the cluster
3. **Audit Trail**: Ensure all instances log to a central, secure audit repository
4. **Secrets Management**: Use a secure, scalable secrets management solution
5. **Session Tracking**: Maintain consistent session tracking across all instances
