### External Service Metrics

| Metric Name | Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `auth_email_delivery_total` | Counter | Total emails sent (verification, password reset) |
| `auth_email_delivery_failure_total` | Counter | Failed email deliveries |

| `auth_social_auth_requests_total` | Counter | Social authentication provider requests |
| `auth_external_service_request_time_seconds` | Histogram | Request time to external services |

## Logs

The Authentication Service uses structured logging with the following log levels:

| Level | Usage |
|----|----|
| ERROR | Unexpected errors that require immediate attention |
| WARN | Potential issues that might require investigation |
| INFO | Important operational events (service start/stop, configuration changes) |
| DEBUG | Detailed information for troubleshooting (disabled in production) |
| TRACE | Very detailed debugging information (never enabled in production) |

### Key Log Events

The following log events should be monitored:

| Log Event | Level | Description | Action Required |
|----|----|----|----|
| `auth.login.failed_attempt` | INFO | Failed login attempt | Monitor for brute force patterns |
| `auth.login.account_locked` | WARN | Account locked due to failed attempts | Investigate if across multiple accounts |
| `auth.token.validation_error` | WARN | Token validation failed | Investigate if spike occurs |
| `auth.key.rotation` | INFO | Cryptographic key rotation | No action, informational |
| `auth.db.connection_error` | ERROR | Database connection failure | Check database health |
| `auth.security.potential_attack` | ERROR | Detected potential security attack | Investigate immediately |
| `auth.config.change` | INFO | Configuration change detected | Verify if expected |

### Log Format

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-06-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "auth-service",
  "traceId": "4a5b6c7d-e8f9-0a1b-2c3d-4e5f6a7b8c9d",
  "spanId": "a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8",
  "message": "User login successful",
  "context": {
    "userId": "usr_123456789",
    "ipAddress": "192.168.1.1",
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
    "authMethod": "password"
  }
}
```

## Health Checks

The service exposes health check endpoints:

* `/health/liveness` - Basic check that the service is running
* `/health/readiness` - Check that the service is ready to accept requests
* `/health/dependency` - Check status of all dependencies

### Dependency Health

The following dependencies are critical for service operation:

| Dependency | Impact if Unavailable | Recovery Strategy |
|----|----|----|
| Database | Unable to authenticate users or validate tokens | Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff |
| Key Management System (if external) | Unable to sign new tokens | Fall back to local key cache |
| Email Service | Unable to send verification or reset emails | Queue messages for retry |
| SMS Provider | Unable to send MFA codes via SMS | Suggest alternative MFA methods |
| Redis/Cache | Reduced performance, increased database load | Service continues with degraded performance |

## Alerting

### Critical Alerts

The following conditions should trigger immediate alerts:

| Condition | Threshold | Impact | Response |
|----|----|----|----|
| High login failure rate | > 20% of attempts over 5 minutes | Possible brute force attack | Investigate IPs and implement additional rate limiting |
| Service unavailable | Health check fails for > 1 minute | Authentication system down | Restart service and check dependencies |
| Database connection failures | > 5 failures in 1 minute | Authentication operations failing | Verify database health and connectivity |
| High token validation failure | > 10% over 5 minutes | Possible replay attack or key issues | Check for key rotation issues or invalid tokens |
| Security anomaly detected | Any security anomaly log | Potential security breach | Investigate logs and consider temporary mitigations |

### Warning Alerts

The following conditions should trigger warning alerts:

| Condition | Threshold | Impact | Response |
|----|----|----|----|
| Elevated login latency | P95 > 500ms over 10 minutes | Degraded user experience | Check system resources and database performance |
| Increased account lockouts | > 5 accounts locked in 5 minutes | Possible coordinated attack | Monitor for patterns in lockout events |
| External service degradation | > 10% failure rate to any external service | Reduced functionality | Check external service status |
| Key rotation overdue | No rotation in configured period | Reduced security posture | Manually trigger key rotation |
| High rate of refresh token usage | > 200% of normal baseline | Possible token theft | Monitor for suspicious patterns |
