# Scaling Considerations

## Overview

The Workflow Orchestrator Service is designed to scale efficiently to handle varying workflow loads. This document outlines strategies for scaling the service both horizontally and vertically, along with considerations for different deployment scenarios.

## Scaling Patterns

### Horizontal Scaling

The Workflow Orchestrator Service supports horizontal scaling through stateless deployment of multiple service instances. Key considerations for horizontal scaling include:

#### Service Instance Distribution

 ![Horizontal Scaling Architecture](../../../diagrams/workflow_orchestrator_scaling.png)


1. **Load Balancer Configuration**:
   * Round-robin distribution for API requests
   * Sticky sessions not required due to stateless design
   * Health check integration for automatic instance removal
2. **Instance Coordination**:
   * Distributed lock manager for scheduler operations
   * Event-based communication for cross-instance coordination
   * Database as the source of truth for workflow state
3. **Instance Sizing Guidelines**:
   * Recommended starting point: 2 vCPUs, 4GB RAM per instance
   * Typical throughput: \~500 workflow steps/minute per instance
   * Scale out at 70% CPU utilization

### Vertical Scaling

For cases where horizontal scaling is constrained, vertical scaling options include:


1. **Memory Optimization**:
   * Increase available memory for larger workflow state caching
   * Adjust JVM/runtime memory settings based on workflow complexity
   * Monitor garbage collection metrics to optimize memory allocation
2. **CPU Enhancement**:
   * Increase CPU allocation for compute-intensive workflows
   * Enable CPU profiling to identify bottlenecks
   * Consider specialized instance types for CPU-bound operations
3. **Constraints**:
   * Single instance throughput limited by database connection pool
   * Event processing capacity limited by single-instance event handlers
   * Network I/O may become limiting factor with large event payloads

## Database Scaling

The database is often the first scaling bottleneck. Consider these strategies:

### Read Replicas


1. **Configuration**:

   ```yaml
   database:
     master:
       url: jdbc:postgresql://primary-db:5432/workflows
       poolSize: 20
     replicas:
       - url: jdbc:postgresql://replica-1:5432/workflows
         poolSize: 30
       - url: jdbc:postgresql://replica-2:5432/workflows
         poolSize: 30
     readPreference: PREFER_REPLICA  # Options: PRIMARY_ONLY, PREFER_REPLICA, NEAREST
   ```
2. **Read/Write Split Strategy**:
   * Workflow state reads directed to replicas
   * Workflow execution history queries to replicas
   * Workflow state updates always to primary
   * Atomic operations requiring consistency to primary
3. **Replica Lag Handling**:
   * Circuit breaker for excessive replica lag (>5s)
   * Read-after-write consistency through primary when needed
   * Exponential backoff for replica selection

### Sharding

For very high-volume deployments, consider database sharding:


1. **Sharding Strategy**:
   * Shard by tenant (for multi-tenant deployments)
   * Shard by workflow type for specialized workflows
   * Consider hash-based sharding for general workloads
2. **Shard Configuration**:

   ```yaml
   database:
     sharding:
       enabled: true
       strategy: TENANT_ID  # Options: TENANT_ID, WORKFLOW_TYPE, HASH
       shards:
         - id: shard-1
           url: jdbc:postgresql://shard-1:5432/workflows
           tenantRange: "A-F"
         - id: shard-2
           url: jdbc:postgresql://shard-2:5432/workflows
           tenantRange: "G-M"
         - id: shard-3
           url: jdbc:postgresql://shard-3:5432/workflows
           tenantRange: "N-Z"
   ```
3. **Cross-Shard Operations**:
   * Minimize cross-shard transactions
   * Implement eventual consistency patterns for cross-shard data
   * Use workflow correlation IDs to track related workflows across shards

## Event Processing Scaling

Scale event processing capabilities with these approaches:

### Dedicated Event Workers


1. **Worker Pool Configuration**:

   ```yaml
   eventProcessing:
     workers:
       minThreads: 10
       maxThreads: 50
       queueCapacity: 1000
       threadPrefix: "event-worker-"
     batchSize: 100
     pollInterval: 500ms
   ```
2. **Event Partitioning**:
   * Partition event subscriptions by event type
   * Dedicate specific workers to high-volume event types
   * Use consistent hashing for event distribution across workers
3. **Backpressure Handling**:
   * Dynamic thread pool sizing based on queue depth
   * Adaptive batch sizing based on processing capacity
   * Circuit breaker for overwhelmed event processing systems

### External Event Processors

For extreme scale, separate event processing from workflow execution:


1. **Architecture**:
   * Dedicated event processing service instances
   * Kafka or similar messaging system for event distribution
   * Specialized event processors for complex event patterns
2. **Configuration**:

   ```yaml
   externalEventProcessing:
     enabled: true
     kafka:
       bootstrapServers: "kafka-1:9092,kafka-2:9092"
       consumerGroup: "workflow-events"
       topics:
         - name: "business-events"
           partitions: 10
         - name: "system-events"
           partitions: 5
       consumerCount: 20
   ```
3. **Operational Considerations**:
   * Monitor consumer lag for processing delays
   * Implement dead letter queues for unprocessable events
   * Consider exactly-once semantics for critical events

## Scheduler Scaling

The scheduler component has unique scaling considerations:

### Distributed Scheduler


1. **Coordination Mechanism**:
   * Distributed lock for leader election
   * Partitioned scheduling by time window
   * Heartbeat mechanism for scheduler instance health
2. **Configuration**:

   ```yaml
   scheduler:
     distributed:
       enabled: true
       lockingMechanism: "database"  # Options: database, zookeeper, redis
       leaderElectionInterval: 30s
       heartbeatInterval: 5s
       timeWindowPartitioning: true
       partitionCount: 12  # Hourly partitions
   ```
3. **Resilience**:
   * Automatic failover for scheduler leader
   * Partition reassignment on instance failure
   * Recovery mechanism for missed schedules

### Specialized Scheduler Instances

For complex scheduling needs:


1. **Scheduler Specialization**:
   * Dedicated long-term scheduler instances
   * High-precision scheduler for sub-second timing
   * Batch schedulers for high-volume, lower-precision needs
2. **Configuration**:

   ```yaml
   schedulerInstances:
     - id: "high-precision"
       type: "HIGH_PRECISION"
       pollInterval: 100ms
       maxScheduledItems: 1000
     - id: "long-term"
       type: "LONG_TERM"
       pollInterval: 60s
       maxScheduledItems: 10000
     - id: "batch"
       type: "BATCH"
       pollInterval: 5s
       maxScheduledItems: 5000
       batchSize: 100
   ```

## Resource Allocation

Guidelines for resource allocation across different deployment scales:

### Small Deployment (up to 1,000 workflows/day)

```yaml

```

### Cloud-Specific Optimizations


1. **AWS**:
   * Use RDS with read replicas for database
   * Consider Aurora for higher throughput
   * Leverage SQS for event queuing
   * Use ElastiCache for distributed locking
2. **Azure**:
   * Use Azure SQL with geo-replication

## Scaling Limitations and Considerations


1. **Database Constraints**:
   * Single database instance typically limits to \~5,000 workflows/minute
   * Connection pool exhaustion can occur before CPU/memory limits
   * Consider database partitioning for time-series workflow data
2. **Network Limitations**:
   * Large event payloads can saturate network bandwidth
   * Cross-zone/region latency impacts distributed operations
   * Consider payload size limits and compression for events
3. **Stateful Operations**:
   * Long-running workflow coordination requires careful scaling
   * Leader election processes limit some operations to single instance
   * Use partitioning strategies for stateful components
4. **Memory Utilization**:
   * Complex workflow state can consume significant memory
   * Consider workflow state size limits (recommended: <1MB per workflow)
   * Implement memory circuit breakers for large workflows
