# Workflow Orchestrator Documentation

## Structure Overview

This documentation covers the Workflow Orchestrator Service, which is responsible for managing workflow execution throughout their lifecycle. The documentation is organized as follows:

### High-Level Documentation

* [Overview](./overview.md): High-level architectural overview
* [Data Model](./data_model.md): Core data structures and schemas

### Detailed Implementation

The `implementation/` directory contains detailed documentation on specific aspects of the Workflow Orchestrator:

* [State Management](./implementation/state_management.md): State persistence and transitions
* [Error Handling](./implementation/error_handling.md): Handling failures and retries
* [Compensation](./implementation/compensation.md): Compensation mechanisms for rollbacks
* [Database Optimization](./implementation/database_optimization.md): Database query patterns
* [Event Processing](./implementation/event_processing.md): Event handling and subscriptions

### Interfaces

The `interfaces/` directory documents the service's public and internal APIs:

* [API Reference](./interfaces/api.md): Public APIs
* [Internal Interfaces](./interfaces/internal.md): Internal communication

### Operations

The `operations/` directory covers operational aspects:

* [Monitoring](./operations/monitoring.md): Monitoring guidelines
* [Scaling](./operations/scaling.md): Scaling considerations
* [Configuration](./operations/configuration.md): Configuration options

### Examples

The `examples/` directory provides practical usage examples:

* [Basic Workflow](./examples/basic_workflow.md): Simple workflow examples
* [Complex Workflow](./examples/complex_workflow.md): Advanced workflow patterns
