# Documentation Migration Plan

This document outlines the plan for migrating from the current monolithic documentation structure to the new modular approach for the Workflow Orchestrator Service.

## Current State

The current documentation consists of:
- A large workflow_orchestrator_service.md file (~1100 lines)
- Mixed content including architecture, implementation details, and examples
- Limited cross-referencing between related topics

## Target State

The target structure follows a modular approach with:
- Content organized by concern (overview, implementation, interfaces, operations, examples)
- Shorter, focused documents for each specific topic
- Clear navigation and cross-references between related documents

## Migration Process

### Phase 1: Establish Structure

1. Create the new directory structure:
   ```
   mkdir -p docs/architecture/components/workflow_orchestrator/{overview,interfaces,implementation,operations,examples}
   ```

2. Create the README.md as a navigation hub

3. Create the overview.md with the high-level architecture

### Phase 2: Content Migration

For each section in the original document:

1. Identify the logical category it belongs to (overview, implementation, etc.)
2. Create the appropriate document in the new structure
3. Copy and adapt the content, enhancing with additional context if needed
4. Add cross-references to related documents

Specifically, migrate content in this order:

1. **Core Overview**
   - Service description
   - Architecture diagram
   - Component descriptions
   - Move to overview.md

2. **Data Model**
   - Schema references
   - Object structures
   - Move to data_model.md

3. **Implementation Details**
   - Extract each functional area to its own file:
     - State Management
     - Error Handling
     - Compensation Mechanisms
     - Database Optimization
     - Event Processing

4. **Interface Definitions**
   - API interfaces
   - Internal interfaces

5. **Operational Guidance**
   - Monitoring
   - Scaling
   - Configuration

6. **Examples**
   - Extract workflow examples to dedicated files

### Phase 3: Validation and Cleanup

1. Review all documents for consistency
2. Validate all cross-references work correctly
3. Update any other documents that reference the workflow orchestrator
4. Add missing content identified during migration
5. Archive the original file once migration is complete

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Establish structure and migrate overview and data model
- **Week 2**: Migrate implementation details
- **Week 3**: Migrate interfaces, operations and examples
- **Week 4**: Validation, cleanup and archiving

## Guidelines for New Content

Once the migration is complete, all new content should:

1. Be added to the appropriate document based on topic
2. Follow a consistent style and formatting
3. Include cross-references to related documents
4. Keep individual documents focused and under 300 lines where possible

## Impact Assessment

### Benefits
- Improved discoverability of specific information
- Easier maintenance of focused documents
- Better separation of concerns
- Reduced cognitive load when reading documentation

### Risks
- Temporary inconsistency during migration
- Potential for broken links if references aren't updated
- Initial learning curve for finding content in the new structure

## Responsible Team

The documentation migration will be led by the Architecture team with support from component owners.

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:
1. All content from the original file is appropriately migrated
2. All cross-references are correct
3. Documentation can be navigated easily via the README
4. New team members can quickly find relevant information
