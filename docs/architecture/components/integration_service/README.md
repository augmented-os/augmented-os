# Integration Service Documentation

## Structure Overview

This documentation covers the Integration Service, which is responsible for providing a unified interface for connecting to external systems and services. The documentation is organized as follows:

### High-Level Documentation

* [Overview](./overview.md): High-level architectural overview
* [Data Model](./data_model.md): Core data structures and schemas

### Detailed Implementation

The `implementation/` directory contains detailed documentation on specific aspects of the Integration Service:

* [Integration Registry](./implementation/integration_registry.md): Manages integration definitions and discovery
* [Adapter Manager](./implementation/adapter_manager.md): Handles integration adapters and lifecycles
* [Credential Manager](./implementation/credential_manager.md): Secures authentication and manages credentials
* [Method Executor](./implementation/method_executor.md): Executes integration operations and handles failures
* [Data Transformer](./implementation/data_transformer.md): Handles data format conversion and mapping

### Interfaces

The `interfaces/` directory documents the service's public and internal APIs:

* [API Reference](./interfaces/api.md): Public APIs for integration management and execution
* [Internal Interfaces](./interfaces/internal.md): Internal communication with other components

### Operations

The `operations/` directory covers operational aspects:

* [Monitoring](./operations/monitoring.md): Monitoring guidelines and metrics
* [Scaling](./operations/scaling.md): Scaling considerations and resilience patterns
* [Configuration](./operations/configuration.md): Configuration options and security considerations

### Examples

The `examples/` directory provides practical usage examples:

* [Basic Example](./examples/basic_example.md): Integration method execution examples
* [Advanced Example](./examples/advanced_example.md): OAuth authentication setup and processing

## How to Use This Documentation

1. **New to the system?** Start with the [Overview](./overview.md) for a high-level understanding
2. **Implementing a new integration?** Check the [Integration Registry](./implementation/integration_registry.md) and [Examples](./examples/) directory
3. **Debugging integration issues?** See the [Method Executor](./implementation/method_executor.md) and [Monitoring](./operations/monitoring.md)
4. **Adding authentication?** Review the [Credential Manager](./implementation/credential_manager.md) and [Advanced Example](./examples/advanced_example.md)
5. **Optimizing performance?** Review the [Scaling](./operations/scaling.md) documentation
