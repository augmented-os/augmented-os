# Integration Service

## Overview

The Integration Service provides a unified interface for connecting to external systems and services. It manages authentication, data transformation, and communication protocols, enabling workflows and tasks to interact with third-party applications seamlessly.

## Key Responsibilities

* Managing integration definitions and configurations
* Securely storing and using authentication credentials
* Executing integration methods against external systems
* Transforming data between system formats
* Handling rate limiting and throttling
* Monitoring integration health and availability
* Providing a consistent interface for all integrations

## Core Components

* **Integration Registry**: Manages integration definitions, versions, discovery mechanisms, and configuration validation.
* **Adapter Manager**: Handles integration adapters, their lifecycle, versioning, and compatibility validation.
* **Credential Manager**: Secures authentication by encrypting credentials, supporting various authentication methods, and managing token rotation.
* **Method Executor**: Executes integration operations by invoking methods on external systems, handling request/response formatting, and implementing circuit breakers.
* **Data Transformer**: Handles data transformation by converting between formats, applying mapping rules, and validating schemas.

## Service Interfaces

The service exposes the following primary interfaces:

* **Task Execution Interface**: Receives integration method calls from the Task Execution Layer.
* **Management API**: Exposes REST endpoints for integration definition and instance management.
* **External Systems Interface**: Connects to third-party services and APIs using appropriate protocols and authentication.
* **Event Interface**: Publishes integration events and status updates to the event system.
