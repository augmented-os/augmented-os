# Scaling Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides guidance on scaling the Integration Service to handle increased load, maintain performance, and ensure reliability. It covers horizontal and vertical scaling strategies, resource requirements, and performance characteristics under different load conditions.

## Resource Requirements

### Base Requirements

The Integration Service has the following base resource requirements per instance:

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------------|-------|
| CPU | 2 cores | 4 cores | Higher CPU needed for data transformation operations |
| Memory | 2 GB | 4 GB | Memory usage increases with concurrent connections |
| Disk | 10 GB | 20 GB | SSD recommended for credential caching and logging |
| Network | 100 Mbps | 1 Gbps | Higher bandwidth needed for large data transfers |

### Scaling Factors

The following factors influence resource requirements:

| Factor | Impact | Scaling Recommendation |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| Number of integration instances | Linear increase in memory usage | Add 256MB memory per 100 active integration instances |
| Concurrent method executions | Increases CPU and connection pool usage | Scale horizontally when exceeding 200 concurrent executions per instance |
| Data transformation complexity | Increases CPU usage | Add CPU cores for complex transformations or large payloads |
| Authentication volume | Increases credential store access | Implement credential caching with appropriate TTL |
| External system latency | Increases thread pool usage | Adjust thread pool size based on external system response times |

## Performance Characteristics

### Throughput

The Integration Service has been tested with the following throughput characteristics:

| Configuration | Operations/Second | Latency (P95) | Resource Utilization |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| 1 instance, 2 CPU, 2 GB RAM | 50 | 800 ms | CPU: 70%, Memory: 65% |
| 2 instances, 2 CPU, 2 GB RAM | 100 | 850 ms | CPU: 65%, Memory: 60% |
| 4 instances, 4 CPU, 4 GB RAM | 400 | 900 ms | CPU: 60%, Memory: 55% |

### Bottlenecks

The following bottlenecks have been identified:

| Bottleneck | Symptoms | Mitigation |
|------------|----------|------------|
| External system rate limits | Increased errors with 429 status codes | Implement adaptive rate limiting with backoff strategy |
| Credential store access | High latency for authentication operations | Cache credentials with appropriate TTL |
| Database connection pool | Connection timeouts, increased latency | Increase connection pool size, optimize query patterns |
| Thread pool exhaustion | Rejected requests, increased latency | Adjust thread pool size, implement request queuing |
| Network bandwidth | Increased latency for large payloads | Compress payloads, implement chunked transfers |

## Horizontal Scaling

The Integration Service is designed to scale horizontally by adding more instances.

### Scaling Strategy

1. **Instance Sizing**: Each instance should be provisioned with 4 CPU cores and 4 GB of memory
2. **Load Balancing**: Requests should be distributed using round-robin load balancing
3. **Scaling Triggers**: Add instances when CPU utilization exceeds 70% for 5 minutes
4. **Maximum Instances**: The service has been tested with up to 20 instances

### Stateful Considerations

The Integration Service maintains the following state that must be considered when scaling:

| State Type | Storage | Scaling Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|---------|----------------|------------|
| Integration definitions | Database | Read-heavy, low impact | Implement caching with TTL |
| Integration instances | Database | Read-heavy, moderate impact | Implement caching with TTL |
| Credentials | Credential store | Read-heavy, high impact | Implement secure local caching |
| Rate limit counters | In-memory | High impact | Use distributed rate limiting solution |
| Circuit breaker state | In-memory | High impact | Use distributed circuit breaker implementation |

## Vertical Scaling

While horizontal scaling is preferred, vertical scaling can be used in the following scenarios:

| Scenario | Vertical Scaling Approach | Limitations |
|----------|---------------------------|------------|
| Limited network egress points | Increase instance size rather than count | Maximum instance size limits ultimate capacity |
| Complex data transformations | Increase CPU allocation | Diminishing returns after 8 cores |
| Large payload processing | Increase memory allocation | JVM garbage collection overhead increases |

### Resource Allocation Guidelines

When vertically scaling, prioritize resources in this order:

1. **Memory**: Increase when seeing high GC activity or OOM errors
2. **CPU**: Increase when seeing high CPU utilization
3. **Network**: Increase when seeing network saturation
4. **Disk**: Rarely a bottleneck except for logging

## Database Scaling

The Integration Service interacts with databases that require their own scaling considerations:

| Database | Scaling Strategy | Connection Pool Sizing | Indexing Recommendations |
|----------|------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Integration Registry DB | Read replicas for definition queries | 10 connections per service instance | Index on definition ID, type, and status |
| Integration Instance DB | Sharding by tenant or integration type | 20 connections per service instance | Index on instance ID, definition ID, and status |

## Caching Strategy

The Integration Service uses caching to improve performance:

| Cache Type | Purpose | Sizing Guidelines | Eviction Policy |
|------------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Definition Cache | Reduce database load for integration definitions | 1000 entries per instance | LRU with 1 hour TTL |
| Instance Cache | Reduce database load for integration instances | 5000 entries per instance | LRU with 30 minute TTL |
| Credential Cache | Reduce credential store access | 1000 entries per instance | LRU with credential-specific TTL |
| Response Cache | Cache responses for idempotent operations | Configurable per integration | TTL based on data freshness requirements |

## Regional Deployment

For multi-region deployments, consider the following:

| Aspect | Recommendation | Rationale |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Data Replication | Replicate integration definitions globally | Definitions are read-heavy and change infrequently |
| Request Routing | Route to region closest to external system | Reduces latency for integration operations |
| Failover Strategy | Active-active with global load balancing | Provides resilience against regional outages |

## Load Testing Results

The following load tests have been conducted:

### Steady Load Test

* **Duration**: 24 hours
* **Request Rate**: 100 requests/second
* **Results**: Stable performance with P95 latency under 900ms

### Spike Test

* **Baseline**: 50 requests/second
* **Spike**: 500 requests/second for 5 minutes
* **Results**: P95 latency increased to 1500ms during spike, recovered within 2 minutes

### Endurance Test

* **Duration**: 7 days
* **Request Rate**: 75 requests/second
* **Results**: No memory leaks or performance degradation observed
