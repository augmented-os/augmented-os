# Task Execution Service Documentation

## Structure Overview

This documentation covers the Task Execution Service, which is responsible for executing individual tasks within workflows. The documentation is organized as follows:

### High-Level Documentation

* [Overview](./overview.md): High-level architectural overview
* [Data Model](./data_model.md): Core data structures and schemas

### Detailed Implementation

The `implementation/` directory contains detailed documentation on specific aspects of the Task Execution Service:

* [Task Router](./implementation/task_router.md): Routing tasks to appropriate executors
* [Automated Task Executor](./implementation/automated_task_executor.md): Execution of automated tasks
* [Manual Task Handler](./implementation/manual_task_handler.md): Handling of manual tasks
* [Integration Task Executor](./implementation/integration_task_executor.md): Execution of integration tasks
* [Task Validator](./implementation/task_validator.md): Validation of task inputs and outputs
  <!-- Add or remove implementation topics as needed -->

### Interfaces

The `interfaces/` directory documents the service's public and internal APIs:

* [API Reference](./interfaces/api.md): Public APIs
* [Internal Interfaces](./interfaces/internal.md): Internal communication

### Operations

The `operations/` directory covers operational aspects:

* [Monitoring](./operations/monitoring.md): Monitoring guidelines
* [Scaling](./operations/scaling.md): Scaling considerations
* [Configuration](./operations/configuration.md): Configuration options

### Examples

The `examples/` directory provides practical usage examples:

* [Basic Example](./examples/basic_example.md): Simple task execution examples
* [Advanced Example](./examples/advanced_example.md): Complex task patterns
