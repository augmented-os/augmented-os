# Resilience Patterns

This document outlines the resilience patterns and failover mechanisms implemented in the Task Execution Service.

## Core Resilience Strategies

### Retry Mechanisms

The Task Execution Service implements intelligent retry logic for handling transient failures:

* **Exponential Backoff**: Increasing delay between retry attempts
* **Jitter**: Random variation in retry timing to prevent thundering herd problems
* **Retry Classification**: Categorization of errors as retryable or non-retryable
* **Configurable Limits**: Maximum retry attempts and timeout settings

```typescript
// Example retry configuration
const retryConfig = {
  maxRetries: 3,
  initialBackoffMs: 1000,
  backoffMultiplier: 2,
  jitterFactor: 0.2
};
```

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures when downstream services are unavailable:

* **Three States**: Closed (normal operation), Open (failing, requests blocked), Half-Open (testing recovery)
* **Failure Thresholds**: Configurable thresholds for opening the circuit
* **Recovery Testing**: Gradual testing of service recovery
* **Timeout-based Reset**: Automatic reset after configurable timeout period

```typescript
// Example circuit breaker implementation
class CircuitBreaker {
  constructor(options = {}) {
    this.failureThreshold = options.failureThreshold || 5;
    this.resetTimeout = options.resetTimeout || 30000;
    this.status = 'CLOSED';
    this.failureCount = 0;
    this.lastFailureTime = null;
  }
  
  // Circuit breaker methods...
}
```

### Bulkhead Pattern

Isolates components to prevent failures from spreading:

* **Resource Partitioning**: Separate thread pools and connection pools for different task types
* **Isolation Boundaries**: Failure in one task type doesn't affect others
* **Resource Limits**: Per-partition resource limits

## Failover Mechanisms

### Active-Passive Deployment

* **Standby Instances**: Maintain standby instances in different availability zones
* **Health Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of active instances
* **Automated Failover**: Automatic promotion of standby to active on failure
* **State Replication**: Continuous replication of task state to standby instances

### Distributed Task Queue

* **Persistent Queues**: Tasks stored in durable message queues
* **Multiple Consumers**: Multiple task executor instances consuming from queues
* **At-least-once Delivery**: Guaranteed task execution even if instances fail
* **Dead Letter Queues**: Special handling for repeatedly failing tasks

## Data Resilience

### Task State Persistence

* **Transactional Updates**: All task state changes are transactional
* **Idempotent Operations**: Task operations designed to be safely retried
* **State Recovery**: Ability to recover task state from persistent storage
* **Checkpoint Mechanism**: Regular state checkpoints during long-running tasks

### Disaster Recovery

* **Regular Backups**: Scheduled backups of task definitions and instances
* **Cross-region Replication**: Optional replication to secondary regions
* **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: < 1 hour for critical tasks
* **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: < 5 minutes data loss

## Graceful Degradation

The system implements graceful degradation strategies when under stress:

* **Priority-based Processing**: Critical tasks processed first during high load
* **Feature Toggles**: Non-essential features can be disabled
* **Timeout Adjustments**: Dynamic timeout adjustment based on system load
* **Load Shedding**: Rejection of low-priority tasks during extreme load

## Monitoring and Recovery

* **Health Checks**: Regular health checks for all components
* **Automated Recovery**: Self-healing mechanisms for common failure scenarios
* **Alerting**: Immediate alerts for resilience mechanism activations
* **Failure Analytics**: Tracking and analysis of failure patterns
