# Task Execution Layer Scaling

## Overview

This document describes the scaling characteristics and strategies for the Task Execution Layer Service. It covers horizontal and vertical scaling approaches, load balancing, resource requirements, and performance considerations at different scales.

## Scaling Dimensions

The Task Execution Layer can scale across multiple dimensions:

1. **Task Volume**: Number of tasks processed per time unit
2. **Task Complexity**: Computational requirements of individual tasks
3. **Concurrent Users**: For manual tasks, number of users interacting with the system
4. **Integration Endpoints**: Number and variety of external systems integrated with
5. **Data Volume**: Size of task inputs and outputs

## Component Scaling Characteristics

Each component of the Task Execution Layer has different scaling characteristics:

| Component | Scaling Type | Stateful | Resource Bottleneck | Scaling Trigger |
|-----------|--------------|----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Task Router | Horizontal | No | CPU | Task routing latency > 100ms |
| Automated Task Executor | Horizontal | No | CPU/Memory | Task queue depth > 100 or wait time > 30s |
| Manual Task Handler | Horizontal | No | CPU | Concurrent users > 1000 |
| Integration Task Executor | Horizontal | No | Network I/O | Task queue depth > 50 or wait time > 60s |
| Task Validator | Horizontal | No | CPU | Validation latency > 200ms |
| Task Database | Vertical + Sharding | Yes | Disk I/O | Read/write latency > 50ms |
| Task Queue | Horizontal | Yes (Clustered) | Network I/O | Message processing time > 100ms |

## Horizontal Scaling

The Task Execution Layer is designed for horizontal scaling of its stateless components:

### Scaling Strategies

1. **Auto-scaling Groups**: Components are deployed in auto-scaling groups that adjust based on:
   * CPU utilization (target: 60-70%)
   * Memory utilization (target: 70-80%)
   * Task queue depth
   * Response time

2. **Independent Scaling**: Each component can scale independently based on its specific load:
   * Task Router scales based on incoming task volume
   * Automated Task Executor scales based on automated task backlog
   * Manual Task Handler scales based on active users
   * Integration Task Executor scales based on integration task volume

3. **Regional Deployment**: Components can be deployed across multiple regions for:
   * Geographic distribution of load
   * Reduced latency for users and integrations
   * Disaster recovery

### Load Balancing

Load is distributed across component instances using:

1. **Task Queue Partitioning**: Tasks are distributed across queue partitions based on:
   * Task type
   * Task priority
   * Source workflow
   * Tenant ID

2. **Consistent Hashing**: Used for routing related tasks to the same executor when beneficial

3. **Sticky Sessions**: For manual tasks, user sessions are routed to the same instance for the duration of their interaction

## Vertical Scaling

Some components benefit from vertical scaling:

1. **Database Tier**: Increasing CPU, memory, and I/O capacity for:
   * Higher transaction throughput
   * Larger working set in memory
   * Faster query execution

2. **Resource-Intensive Executors**: For specialized automated tasks that require:
   * Large memory allocation
   * High CPU core count
   * GPU acceleration
   * Specialized hardware

## Resource Requirements

### Base Configuration

Minimum resource requirements for a production deployment:

| Component | Instances | CPU | Memory | Disk | Network |
|-----------|-----------|-----|--------|------|---------|
| Task Router | 2 | 2 cores | 4 GB | 20 GB | 1 Gbps |
| Automated Task Executor | 3 | 4 cores | 8 GB | 40 GB | 1 Gbps |
| Manual Task Handler | 2 | 2 cores | 4 GB | 20 GB | 1 Gbps |
| Integration Task Executor | 2 | 2 cores | 4 GB | 20 GB | 1 Gbps |
| Task Validator | 2 | 2 cores | 4 GB | 20 GB | 1 Gbps |
| Task Database | 1 primary, 2 replicas | 8 cores | 32 GB | 500 GB SSD | 10 Gbps |
| Task Queue | 3-node cluster | 4 cores | 16 GB | 100 GB SSD | 10 Gbps |

### Scaling Increments

Recommended scaling increments based on load:

| Metric | Resource Addition |
|--------|-------------------|
| +1000 tasks/hour | +1 Task Router instance |
| +500 concurrent automated tasks | +2 Automated Task Executor instances |
| +1000 active users | +1 Manual Task Handler instance |
| +200 concurrent integration tasks | +1 Integration Task Executor instance |
| +5000 task validations/hour | +1 Task Validator instance |
| +1M task records | +100 GB database storage |
| +50% database load | Double database resources |

## Scaling Patterns

### Task Type Specialization

For high-volume deployments, executors can be specialized by task type:

1. **Dedicated Executor Pools**: Separate executor pools for:
   * Short-running vs. long-running tasks
   * Memory-intensive vs. CPU-intensive tasks
   * High-priority vs. low-priority tasks

2. **Affinity-Based Routing**: Tasks are routed to executors with:
   * Specialized capabilities
   * Cached dependencies
   * Proximity to data sources

### Multi-Tenancy Scaling

For multi-tenant deployments:

1. **Tenant Isolation**: Critical tenants can have dedicated:
   * Executor instances
   * Queue partitions
   * Database shards

2. **Resource Quotas**: Tenants are allocated resource quotas for:
   * Maximum concurrent tasks
   * Task execution time
   * Storage allocation
   * Integration rate limits

3. **Noisy Neighbor Mitigation**: Prevents high-volume tenants from impacting others through:
   * Rate limiting
   * Fair scheduling
   * Resource isolation

## Performance Benchmarks

## Scaling Limitations

Current architectural limitations to be aware of:

1. **Database Scaling**: Database performance becomes a bottleneck at extremely high task volumes (>1M tasks/day)
   * Mitigation: Implement database sharding by tenant or time period

2. **Task Interdependencies**: Highly interdependent tasks limit parallelization benefits
   * Mitigation: Optimize workflow design to reduce tight coupling between tasks

3. **Integration Rate Limits**: External system rate limits can constrain integration task throughput
   * Mitigation: Implement rate limiting and backoff strategies per integration endpoint

4. **Manual Task Bottlenecks**: Human processing time becomes the bottleneck for manual tasks
   * Mitigation: Optimize UI for efficiency, implement task prioritization and load balancing

## Scaling Recommendations

Best practices for scaling the Task Execution Layer:

1. **Monitor Key Metrics**:
   * Task queue depth and processing time
   * Component CPU and memory utilization
   * Database read/write latency
   * End-to-end task execution time

2. **Proactive Scaling**:
   * Scale before reaching resource limits
   * Implement predictive scaling based on historical patterns
   * Plan for 2x peak capacity for critical components

3. **Performance Testing**:
   * Regularly test with production-like workloads
   * Simulate peak load scenarios
   * Identify bottlenecks before they impact production

4. **Optimize Before Scaling**:
   * Identify and fix inefficient task implementations
   * Optimize database queries and indexes
   * Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   * Tune JVM/runtime parameters for optimal performance
