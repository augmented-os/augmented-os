# Context Management

## Overview

Context Management in the Chat Interface enables users to add, view, and manipulate the contextual information available to the system during conversations. This feature empowers users to tailor interactions by providing relevant background information, constraints, or preferences that guide system responses and actions.

## Key Features

* **Explicit Context Addition**: Ability to manually add contextual information
* **Implicit Context Tracking**: Automatic tracking of conversation history and user actions
* **Context Visualization**: Ways to view and understand active context
* **Context Editing**: Ability to modify or remove contextual elements
* **Context Persistence**: Options to save and reuse context across sessions
* **Context Scoping**: Control over how long specific context remains active

## Context Types

### User-Provided Context

Users can explicitly add the following types of context:

* **Document Context**: Attaching or referencing documents and files
* **Domain Context**: Specifying the subject domain or area of focus
* **Preference Context**: Setting constraints or preferences for responses
* **Role Context**: Defining personas or roles for the system to adopt
* **Project Context**: Associating conversations with specific projects or workspaces

### System-Tracked Context

The system automatically maintains:

* **Conversation History**: Previous messages and interactions
* **User Profile**: User preferences, permissions, and history
* **Resource Access**: Recently accessed workflows, tasks, and data
* **Temporal Context**: Time-based information (time of day, date, deadlines)
* **Spatial Context**: Device location and environmental factors (when available)

## User Experience

### Context Panel

The Context Panel provides a dedicated interface for viewing and managing context:

* Accessible via a side panel or expandable section in the chat interface
* Visualizes active context as cards or expandable sections
* Provides controls for adding, editing, or removing context items
* Indicates source of context (user-provided vs. system-inferred)
* Shows context influence on current interaction
* Enables saving context configurations for future reuse

### Context Commands

Users can manage context through natural language commands:

* "Add context: [information]"
* "Consider this document as context"
* "Forget what I said about [topic]"
* "Save this context as [name]"
* "Load context from [name/source]"
* "Clear all context"
* "Show active context"

## Implementation Considerations

### Context Storage Model

Context is stored as a structured data model:

* Each context item has a type, value, source, and timestamp
* Context items can have relationships to other items
* Context has a scope (message, conversation, session, or persistent)
* Context items have priority levels that affect their influence
* Context can include metadata about its usage and relevance

### Context Injection

The system supports multiple methods for adding context:

* Direct text input in a dedicated context field
* Drag-and-drop of files and documents
* URL sharing to import web content
* Integration with system clipboard
* Context extraction from selected text in the conversation
* Importing from external systems (e.g., CRM, documentation)

### Context Prioritization

When managing large amounts of context:

* Recent context is typically prioritized over older context
* Explicitly provided context takes precedence over inferred context
* Context relevance is continuously evaluated based on the current conversation
* Context can be "pinned" to ensure it remains prioritized
* Context window management optimizes for most relevant information

### Privacy and Control

Users maintain control over context:

* Clear visibility into what context is active
* Easy mechanisms to remove sensitive or irrelevant context
* Options to control automatic context tracking
* Transparency about how context influences responses
* Privacy-focused handling of sensitive contextual information

## User Scenarios

### Research Analysis

1. User uploads a research paper as context
2. User asks: "Summarize the key findings"
3. System responds based specifically on the paper's content
4. User adds preference context: "Focus on methodology details"
5. System adjusts future responses to emphasize methodological aspects
6. User saves this context configuration as "Research Paper Analysis"

### Technical Troubleshooting

1. User adds context about their system configuration
2. System leverages this information when providing troubleshooting advice
3. User shares error logs as additional context
4. System analyzes logs and adjusts recommendations accordingly
5. User modifies context to indicate which solutions have been tried
6. System refines further suggestions based on updated context
