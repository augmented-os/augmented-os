### Conversation History

Users can access and manage their conversation history:

* Searchable archive of past conversations
* Filtering by date, topic, or included resources
* Ability to continue previous conversations
* Options to bookmark important conversations
* Export functionality for conversation logs
* Privacy controls including selective deletion

### Favorites and Shortcuts

Users can create and manage favorites:

* Saving frequently used commands
* Creating command templates with placeholders
* Organizing favorites into categories
* Assigning keyboard shortcuts to favorites
* Creating quick-access buttons for common actions
* Sharing favorites with team members

## Implementation Considerations

### User Profile Storage

User preferences and history are stored in:

* **User Profile Database**: Core preferences and settings
* **Local Storage**: Device-specific settings and caches
* **Sync Service**: Cross-device preference synchronization
* **Versioned Storage**: History of preference changes
* **Encrypted Storage**: Secure storage of sensitive preferences
* **Portable Format**: Export/import capabilities for preferences

### Adaptive Learning

The system learns from user behavior through:

* **Usage Pattern Analysis**: Identification of common workflows
* **Command Frequency Tracking**: Noting frequently used commands
* **Timing Analysis**: Observing when certain features are used
* **Explicit Feedback**: Processing direct feedback on suggestions
* **A/B Preference Testing**: Offering alternatives to refine preferences
* **Cross-User Pattern Recognition**: Learning from similar users (anonymized)

### Privacy and Security

User data is protected through:

* **Granular Privacy Controls**: Fine-grained control over what is stored
* **Clear Data Policies**: Transparent information on data use
* **Retention Limits**: User-configurable data retention periods
* **Data Portability**: Easy export of personal data
* **Right to be Forgotten**: Complete data deletion options
* **Consent Management**: Clear opt-in for adaptive features

### Performance Considerations

Personalization is optimized for performance:

* **Lazy Loading**: Loading preferences only when needed
* **Cached Preferences**: Local caching of frequently used settings
* **Throttled Sync**: Background synchronization of preference changes
* **Change Batching**: Grouping preference updates for efficiency
* **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality without personalization
* **Fallback Defaults**: Sensible defaults when preferences unavailable

## Usage Examples

### Setting Up Personal Preferences

```
User: I'd like to customize the interface
System: I can help you customize your experience. What aspects would you like to change?
User: I prefer dark mode and want larger text
System: [Shows preference panel with theme and text size options]
        I've opened the interface preferences. You can set the theme to Dark and 
        increase the text size. Would you like to see a preview of these changes?
User: Yes, show me how it will look
System: [Updates the interface with preview]
        Here's a preview of Dark mode with larger text. 
        Would you like to keep these changes?
User: Yes, and I also want to set my default input to voice
System: [Updates preference panel to show input settings]
        I've saved your interface preferences and opened the interaction settings.
        You can set your default input method to voice here. Would you like me to
        enable voice input right away?
```

### Using Conversation History

```
User: Find our conversation from last week about the marketing budget
System: I found several conversations about the marketing budget from last week:
        [Displays list of relevant past conversations with dates and snippets]
User: Open the one where we discussed the Q3 campaign
System: [Opens the selected conversation]
        I've opened our conversation from May 15th about the Q3 marketing campaign budget.
        You were analyzing the allocation of the $250,000 budget across different channels.
        Would you like to continue this conversation or export the data we discussed?
User: Continue the conversation and show me the budget breakdown chart again
System: [Restores conversation context and displays the budget chart in the RHS]
        I've restored our previous context. Here's the budget breakdown chart we created.
        The largest allocation was $100,000 for digital advertising, followed by $75,000
        for events. What would you like to adjust in this budget plan?
