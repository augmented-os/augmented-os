# Connector Setup

## Overview

The Connector Setup experience provides a guided, intuitive interface for creating and configuring integration instances that connect the AugmentedOS platform to external systems and services. This experience walks users through the process of selecting an integration type, configuring its parameters, defining its context, and preparing it for authentication.

## Implementation Considerations

### Component Architecture

The Connector Setup experience is built using these key components:


1. **Catalog Browser Component**: Manages the display and filtering of available integrations
2. **Configuration Wizard Component**: Guides users through the setup process
3. **Schema-driven Form Engine**: Dynamically generates forms based on integration schemas
4. **Validation Engine**: Validates configuration against schemas and business rules
5. **Context Manager**: Handles scope and permission configuration

### Configuration Storage

The system securely stores and manages configuration data:

* **Configuration Versioning**: Maintains history of configuration changes
* **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps configuration separate from credentials
* **Encryption**: Encrypts sensitive configuration values
* **Schema Validation**: Ensures stored configurations match current schemas
* **Backup and Recovery**: Provides mechanisms for configuration backup and restoration

### Performance Considerations

To ensure optimal performance during setup:

* **Progressive Loading**: Loads catalog and configuration options as needed
* **Caching**: Caches frequently used integration definitions
* **Asynchronous Validation**: Performs validation without blocking the UI
* **Optimized Schema Processing**: Efficiently processes large configuration schemas
* **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different devices and screen sizes

## User Scenarios

### Marketing Specialist Scenario

Sophia, a marketing specialist, needs to integrate the company's marketing automation platform with their CRM system to synchronize customer data. She navigates to the Integration Catalog and filters for marketing integrations. She finds the Marketo connector and clicks to view details.

After reviewing the capabilities and requirements, Sophia clicks "Add Integration" to begin the setup process. She names the integration "Marketing Automation Bridge" and provides a description. The system presents a form with Marketo-specific configuration options, including the Marketo instance URL and API endpoint paths.

Sophia defines the context as client-specific, selecting the marketing department as the client to limit access to marketing team members. She sets usage limitations to ensure the integration doesn't exceed Marketo's API rate limits.

After completing the configuration, Sophia reviews the summary and validates it. The system confirms that all required fields are properly filled out and the configuration is valid. She proceeds to the authentication step to set up the OAuth connection to Marketo.

### System Administrator Scenario

Raj, a system administrator, needs to set up multiple database connections for different departments. He starts by configuring a PostgreSQL connection for the finance team. In the Integration Catalog, he filters for database connectors and selects PostgreSQL.

During the configuration, Raj enters the database server information, port, and database name. He uses the advanced options to configure connection pooling settings and timeout parameters. For the context, he selects client-specific and assigns it to the finance department.

After completing the first integration, Raj needs to create similar connections for three other departments. Instead of starting from scratch, he uses the "Duplicate" function on the finance database connection. For each copy, he modifies only the database name and client context, keeping the server configuration the same.

Raj uses the batch validation feature to verify all four configurations at once. The system reports that all configurations are valid. He then proceeds to set up authentication for each connection, using different credential sets appropriate for each department's access level.

## Customization Options

The Connector Setup experience offers several customization options:

* **Custom Fields**: Organization-specific fields can be added to integration configurations
* **Approval Workflows**: Optional approval processes for new integration setups
* **Default Templates**: Organization-defined templates for common integration patterns
* **Field Presets**: Default values for common configuration fields
* **Custom Categories**: Organization-specific categorization of integrations
* **Branded Experience**: Customizable UI elements to match organizational branding

## Accessibility Considerations

The Connector Setup experience prioritizes accessibility with:

* **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete setup possible using only keyboard
* **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA labels and semantic HTML for screen reader users
* **High Contrast Mode**: Enhanced visibility for users with visual impairments
* **Text Scaling**: Support for enlarged text without breaking layouts
* **Error Identification**: Multiple cues (color, icon, text) for validation errors
* **Focus Management**: Clear visual indicators of focused elements
