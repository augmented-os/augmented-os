## Implementation Considerations

### Component Architecture

The Authentication Management experience is built using these key components:

1. **Authentication Method Selector**: Presents and explains available authentication options
2. **OAuth Handler**: Manages OAuth authorization flows and token lifecycle
3. **Credential Manager**: Securely stores and retrieves authentication credentials
4. **Token Refresher**: Automatically refreshes expired tokens
5. **Authentication Tester**: Validates authentication credentials

### Security Measures

To ensure secure credential management:

* **Encryption at Rest**: All credentials are encrypted in the database
* **Encryption in Transit**: Secure transmission of credentials
* **Minimal Display**: Credentials are never fully displayed in the UI
* **Secure Input**: Special secure input fields for credential entry
* **Access Controls**: Fine-grained permissions for credential management
* **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of credential access and changes

### Credential Lifecycle Management

The system implements several strategies for credential lifecycle:

* **Automatic Refresh**: Proactive refresh of tokens before expiration
* **Expiration Monitoring**: Alerts for credentials nearing expiration
* **Scheduled Rotation**: Support for regular credential rotation
* **Revocation Handling**: Proper handling of revoked credentials
* **Backup Credentials**: Optional backup authentication methods
* **Credential Health Checks**: Regular validation of stored credentials

## User Scenarios

### Marketing Manager Scenario

Lisa, a marketing manager, needs to connect the company's email marketing platform to their CRM system. After selecting the Mailchimp integration and configuring the connector, she reaches the authentication step.

The system indicates that Mailchimp supports OAuth 2.0 authentication, which is recommended for security. Lisa clicks "Set Up OAuth" and is presented with configuration options. The system has pre-filled most fields, but Lisa needs to select which permission scopes to request. She selects scopes for reading audience data and creating campaigns.

When she clicks "Authorize," the system redirects her to Mailchimp's login page. Lisa logs in with her Mailchimp credentials and approves the requested permissions. She's then redirected back to the platform, where she sees that the authentication was successful. The system displays partial information about the access token and indicates that it will automatically refresh when needed.

Lisa proceeds to test the connection, which confirms that the authentication is working correctly. She completes the setup, and the integration is now ready to use in workflows.

### IT Security Officer Scenario

Michael, an IT security officer, is reviewing and updating the authentication for several critical integrations. He navigates to the Integration Management section and filters for integrations with API key authentication, which company policy requires to be rotated quarterly.

For each integration, Michael accesses the Authentication Management interface. He sees that the payment gateway integration is using an API key that's approaching its scheduled rotation date. He clicks "Rotate API Key" and is guided through the process of generating a new key in the payment gateway's admin portal.

Michael enters the new API key in the secure input field and clicks "Update." The system stores the new key securely and offers to test the connection with the new credentials. After confirming the test is successful, Michael schedules the old key for deactivation after a 48-hour grace period to ensure any in-progress operations complete successfully.

Before finishing, Michael reviews the audit log to confirm that all authentication changes have been properly recorded for compliance purposes. He also verifies that email notifications are set up to alert the team when any authentication credentials are approaching expiration.

## Troubleshooting Features

The Authentication Management experience includes tools for diagnosing and resolving authentication issues:

* **Connection Tester**: Validates authentication with the external system
* **Error Decoder**: Translates error codes into actionable information
* **Auth Flow Visualizer**: Displays the authentication flow for debugging
* **Token Inspector**: Provides details about token content and status
* **Log Viewer**: Shows authentication-related log entries
* **Credential Validator**: Checks credential format and validity

## Accessibility Considerations

The Authentication Management experience prioritizes accessibility with:

* **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete authentication setup possible using only keyboard
* **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA labels and semantic HTML for screen reader users
* **High Contrast Mode**: Enhanced visibility for users with visual impairments
* **Text Scaling**: Support for enlarged text without breaking layouts
* **Error Identification**: Multiple cues (color, icon, text) for authentication errors
* **Focus Management**: Clear visual indicators of focused elements
