## User Scenarios

### Integration Developer Scenario

David, an integration developer, is implementing a new integration with a payment processing service. After configuring the basic connection and authentication, he needs to test the integration's functionality before making it available to workflow designers.

David opens the Testing Console and navigates to the payment processing integration. He sees a list of available methods and selects "Process Payment" to test first. The system presents a form with all required parameters for the method, including amount, currency, payment method, and customer information.

David fills in the test parameters, using the sample data library to populate customer information with realistic but non-production data. He toggles on the "Sandbox Mode" option to ensure the test runs against the payment processor's test environment rather than the production system.

When he executes the test, the console displays a detailed view of the request being sent, including headers, authentication information (securely masked), and the request body. After a moment, the response appears, showing a successful test payment transaction with a transaction ID and status.

David uses the "Save Test Case" feature to store this test configuration for future use. He then proceeds to test error scenarios by modifying the parameters to include invalid data, ensuring the integration handles errors gracefully. Finally, he creates a test suite that includes all the payment-related methods and schedules it to run daily to ensure the integration continues to function correctly.

### Business Analyst Scenario

Jennifer, a business analyst, needs to verify that a recently updated CRM integration still works correctly with the company's custom fields and workflows. She navigates to the Testing Integrations section and selects the CRM integration from the list.

Jennifer opens the Test Suite Manager and sees that there's already a comprehensive test suite for the CRM integration. She reviews the test cases to ensure they cover the custom fields that were recently added. Finding that they don't, she creates a new test case specifically for the custom field functionality.

In the test case builder, Jennifer selects the "Update Contact" method and configures it with sample data that includes the new custom fields. She uses the parameter editor to carefully structure the data according to the CRM's requirements. Before running the test, she uses the validation tool to verify that her test data matches the expected schema.

When she runs the test, she discovers that one of the custom fields is not being properly sent to the CRM. Using the request inspector, she identifies that the field name in the request doesn't match the expected format. Jennifer adjusts the parameter and runs the test again, this time successfully.

Jennifer adds her new test case to the existing test suite and generates a report showing the successful validation of all CRM functionality, including the new custom fields. She shares this report with the implementation team as confirmation that the integration is ready for production use.
