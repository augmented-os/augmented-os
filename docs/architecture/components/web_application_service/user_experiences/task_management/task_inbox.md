# Task Inbox and Notification System

## Overview

The Task Inbox is the central hub for managing and organizing tasks assigned to users within the AugmentedOS platform. It provides a comprehensive view of all tasks requiring attention, with powerful filtering, sorting, and categorization capabilities to help users efficiently manage their workload. Integrated with a real-time notification system, the Task Inbox ensures users stay informed about new assignments, updates, and approaching deadlines.

## Implementation Considerations

### Component Architecture

The Task Inbox is built using these key components:

1. **Task List Component**: Handles rendering and interaction with the task list
2. **Filter Engine**: Processes and applies complex filtering rules
3. **Notification Manager**: Handles notification delivery and state
4. **Task Preview Component**: Renders the preview panel with task details
5. **Action Handler**: Processes task actions and updates

### Data Management

Efficient data handling is critical for the Task Inbox performance:

* **Virtual Scrolling**: Only renders visible items in large task lists
* **Data Pagination**: Fetches data in chunks as needed
* **Optimistic Updates**: Updates UI immediately before server confirmation
* **Background Synchronization**: Keeps task data fresh without disrupting the user
* **Offline Support**: Allows basic functionality when connectivity is limited

### Notification Delivery

The notification system employs several strategies for effective delivery:

* **Priority-based Delivery**: Delivers notifications based on importance
* **Intelligent Batching**: Groups related notifications to reduce interruptions
* **Delivery Windows**: Respects user-defined quiet periods
* **Cross-device Synchronization**: Maintains notification state across devices
* **Delivery Confirmation**: Tracks notification delivery and read status

## User Scenarios

### Knowledge Worker Scenario

Alex, a knowledge worker, starts his day by opening the Task Inbox. He has 27 tasks assigned to him across different projects. He first applies his saved "Today's Focus" filter, which shows tasks that are due today or are marked as high priority. The system displays 8 tasks matching these criteria.

Alex notices a notification badge indicating 3 new tasks have been assigned since he last checked. He clicks on the notification center and sees that two tasks are related to a project proposal due tomorrow, while the third is a request for information from a colleague. He clicks on the proposal tasks to preview them, then uses the bulk action feature to move both to his "Working Now" category.

As he works through his tasks, Alex uses the preview panel to quickly check details without fully opening each task. For complex tasks, he clicks through to the full task execution interface. Throughout the day, he receives notifications about task updates, which appear in the notification center without disrupting his workflow.

### Manager Scenario

Priya, a team manager, uses the Task Inbox to monitor her team's workload. She switches to the "Team View" filter, which shows all tasks assigned to her direct reports. She groups the tasks by assignee and sorts by due date to identify any team members who might be overloaded.

She notices that one team member has several high-priority tasks due on the same day. Using the bulk selection feature, she selects two of these tasks and reassigns them to another team member who has more capacity. The system automatically sends notifications to both team members about the reassignment.

Later, Priya receives a notification about a blocked task that requires her approval. She clicks on the notification, which takes her directly to the task in question. From the preview panel, she can see all the relevant details and approve the task without having to navigate to a different screen.

## Customization Options

The Task Inbox offers several customization options to adapt to different user preferences and workflows:

* **Column Configuration**: Users can select which columns to display and their order
* **Color Coding**: Custom color schemes for different task types or statuses
* **Notification Preferences**: Granular control over notification types and delivery methods
* **Default Views**: User-defined default views when opening the inbox
* **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Customizable shortcuts for common actions
* **Theme Support**: Light and dark mode with customizable accent colors

## Accessibility Considerations

The Task Inbox is designed with accessibility in mind:

* **Keyboard Navigation**: Full functionality available through keyboard shortcuts
* **Screen Reader Support**: Semantic markup and ARIA labels for screen readers
* **Focus Management**: Clear visual indicators of focused elements
* **Color Contrast**: High contrast options for visual elements
* **Text Scaling**: Support for browser text scaling without layout issues
* **Reduced Motion**: Options to minimize animations for users with vestibular disorders
