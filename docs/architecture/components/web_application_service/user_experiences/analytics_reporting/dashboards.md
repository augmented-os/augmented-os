## User Scenarios

### Operations Director Scenario

James, an Operations Director, starts his day by opening his "Operations Overview" dashboard. This dashboard, which he customized for his role, displays key metrics including active workflows, task completion rates, system performance, and any critical alerts.

The dashboard is configured to show data for the current day by default, but James adjusts the time range selector to view the past week for context. He notices a spike in workflow failures on Tuesday and clicks on the chart to drill down. The system presents a detailed view showing that most failures occurred in the order processing workflow.

James adds a filter to focus on order processing workflows and sees that the failures coincided with a system update. He clicks on a specific failure instance to view the detailed logs, which confirm his suspicion that the update caused the issue. He adds an annotation to the dashboard noting this finding.

James then switches to the "Resource Utilization" widget, which shows that one of the processing servers is consistently running at high capacity. He decides this requires attention and uses the dashboard's sharing feature to export a snapshot of the relevant widgets to include in an email to the infrastructure team. Before closing the dashboard, he sets up an alert to notify him if similar failure patterns occur in the future.

### Business Analyst Scenario

Elena, a Business Analyst, needs to create a dashboard to track the performance of a new customer onboarding process. She navigates to the Dashboard Gallery and clicks "Create New Dashboard." From the template library, she selects the "Process Performance" template as a starting point.

The template provides a basic layout with widgets for process completion time, success rate, and volume. Elena renames the dashboard to "Customer Onboarding Analytics" and begins customizing it for her specific needs. She adds a filter for customer type to allow segmentation of the data.

From the Widget Library, Elena adds several new widgets: a funnel chart showing progression through onboarding stages, a table displaying bottlenecks in the process, and a comparison chart showing performance against targets. For each widget, she configures the data source to pull information specific to the onboarding workflows.

Elena arranges the widgets in a logical flow, placing high-level KPIs at the top and detailed breakdowns below. She configures the dashboard to refresh data every 15 minutes and sets up scheduled exports to generate a PDF report every Monday morning. After testing the dashboard with different filters and time ranges, she shares it with her team, setting permissions to allow viewing but restricting editing to herself and her manager.

* **Personal Preferences**: User-specific settings for default views and behaviors
* **Conditional Formatting**: Rules-based formatting based on data values
