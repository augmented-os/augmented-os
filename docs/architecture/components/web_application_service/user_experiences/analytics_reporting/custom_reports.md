## User Scenarios

### Financial Analyst Scenario

David, a Financial Analyst, needs to create a quarterly expense analysis report that compares actual expenses against budgeted amounts across departments. He navigates to the Custom Reports section and clicks "Create New Report."

In the Report Builder, David selects two data sources: the expense transactions database and the annual budget allocations. He uses the join configuration to connect these sources based on department and expense category. From the field explorer, he selects relevant fields including department, expense category, transaction date, actual amount, and budgeted amount.

David adds a calculated field to compute the variance percentage between actual and budgeted expenses. He configures filters to limit the data to the current quarter and adds a parameter that allows report consumers to select specific departments or view all departments.

For visualizations, David adds a summary table showing the expense breakdown by department and category, with conditional formatting to highlight variances exceeding 10%. He also adds a bar chart comparing actual vs. budgeted expenses by department and a trend line showing monthly expense patterns within the quarter.

After arranging these elements in the layout designer, David saves the report and configures it to run automatically at the end of each quarter. He sets permissions to share it with the finance team and department heads, and creates a scheduled distribution to email the report to key stakeholders when new data is available.

### Marketing Manager Scenario

Sophia, a Marketing Manager, wants to analyze the performance of recent marketing campaigns across different channels. She opens the Custom Reports interface and selects "New Report" to begin.

From the data source catalog, Sophia selects the campaign performance database, CRM data, and website analytics. She uses the query builder to focus on campaigns from the past six months and configures joins to connect customer responses with campaign exposure.

Sophia creates several calculated fields: conversion rate, cost per acquisition, and ROI for each campaign and channel. She adds parameters allowing users to filter by campaign type, target audience segment, and date range, making the report interactive and reusable for future analysis.

For visualizations, Sophia creates a performance scorecard showing key metrics for each campaign, a funnel visualization displaying customer journey conversion rates, and a scatter plot comparing cost per acquisition against conversion rate to identify the most efficient channels.

Sophia uses the layout designer to create a logical flow through the report, starting with executive summary metrics and progressing to detailed breakdowns. She adds text annotations explaining key findings and recommendations based on the data. After saving the report, she shares it with her team and schedules a weekly refresh to keep the data current as new campaign results come in.
