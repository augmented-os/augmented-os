# Dynamic UI System

## Overview

The Dynamic UI System provides the capability to render user interfaces dynamically based on JSON schema definitions stored in the database. This system enables the creation of forms, displays, and interactive components without requiring code changes, supporting the platform's workflow and task management capabilities.

The system follows a "start simple, build complexity" philosophy - beginning with basic React components that consume JSON schemas and evolving to support more sophisticated features as needed.

## Key Responsibilities

* Render forms dynamically from JSON schema definitions
* Display data using configurable display templates
* Handle user interactions and form submissions
* Validate user input based on schema-defined rules
* Integrate with the broader state management system
* Provide consistent styling and accessibility features

## Implementation Approach

The Dynamic UI System is built on these core principles:

1. **Schema-Driven Rendering** - All UI components are generated from JSON schemas stored in the database
2. **Component Composition** - Complex interfaces are built by composing simple, reusable React components
3. **Progressive Enhancement** - Start with basic functionality and add features incrementally
4. **State Integration** - Seamlessly integrate with existing Redux state management
5. **Accessibility First** - Built-in accessibility features for all generated components
6. **Performance Conscious** - Efficient rendering and minimal re-renders

## System Architecture

### Core Components

The system consists of three primary React components:

* **DynamicForm** - Renders interactive forms from schema definitions
* **DynamicDisplay** - Shows formatted data using template-based rendering
* **DynamicModal** - Provides modal dialogs containing forms or displays

### Component Hierarchy

```
DynamicUIRenderer
├── DynamicForm
│   ├── FormField (text, number, select, etc.)
│   ├── FormActions (submit, cancel buttons)
│   └── FormValidation
├── DynamicDisplay
│   ├── DisplayContent (templated content)
│   └── DisplayActions (action buttons)
└── DynamicModal
    ├── ModalHeader
    ├── ModalContent (form or display)
    └── ModalActions
```

### Schema Structure

The system processes UI component schemas with this basic structure:

* **Component Metadata** - ID, name, type, title
* **Form Fields** - Field definitions with types, validation, and options
* **Actions** - Button definitions with styling and behavior
* **Display Templates** - HTML templates with data placeholders
* **Layout Configuration** - Optional layout and styling directives

## Integration Points

### State Management Integration

The dynamic UI components integrate with the existing Redux state management system:

* **Schema Storage** - Cache frequently used schemas in Redux state
* **Form Data Management** - Track form state and user inputs
* **Loading States** - Manage loading and error states for schema fetching
* **Action Dispatching** - Integrate form submissions with existing Redux actions

### Database Integration

Schemas are stored in and fetched from the `ui_components` table:

* **Schema Retrieval** - API endpoints for fetching component schemas
* **Caching Strategy** - Intelligent caching to minimize database queries
* **Version Management** - Support for schema versioning and updates

### Component Library Integration

The dynamic components leverage the existing component library:

* **Base Components** - Use existing form inputs, buttons, and layout components
* **Styling System** - Apply consistent theming and design tokens
* **Accessibility Features** - Inherit accessibility features from base components

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (MVP)
- Basic form rendering (text, number, select, textarea)
- Simple validation (required, type checking)
- Basic display templates with string replacement
- Redux integration for state management
- Basic styling and accessibility

### Phase 2: Enhanced Forms
- Conditional field visibility (`visibleIf` logic)
- Additional field types (date, checkbox, radio)
- Cross-field validation
- Form sections and layout options

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Multi-step forms and wizards
- File upload support
- Rich text editing capabilities
- Advanced template engine with helpers

### Phase 4: Optimization
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Advanced caching strategies
- Bundle size optimization
- Comprehensive accessibility audit

## Performance Considerations

### Initial Optimizations

* **Schema Caching** - Cache frequently used schemas in Redux state
* **Lazy Loading** - Only load schemas when components are rendered
* **Component Memoization** - Use React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
* **Debounced Validation** - Limit validation frequency for better performance

### Monitoring Metrics

Key performance indicators to track:
- Schema fetch time
- Form render time
- Validation execution time
- User interaction response time

## Current Limitations

1. **Basic Field Types** - Limited to essential form field types initially
2. **Simple Validation** - Only basic validation rules in MVP
3. **Static Templates** - Display templates use simple string replacement
4. **No Conditional Logic** - `visibleIf` conditions planned for Phase 2
5. **Basic Styling** - Initial implementation relies on existing CSS classes

## Success Criteria

The MVP implementation will be considered successful when:

- [ ] Forms can be rendered from JSON schemas stored in the database
- [ ] Form validation works with clear error messaging
- [ ] Form submissions integrate with existing Redux state management
- [ ] Data can be displayed using templates from the database
- [ ] Basic accessibility features function correctly
- [ ] Performance meets acceptable thresholds for user experience
