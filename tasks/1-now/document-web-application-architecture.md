# Task: Document Web Application Architecture

## Metadata

* **ID**: TASK-DOC-WAA-001
* **Type**: Documentation
* **Estimated Effort**: 4 story points
* **Created**: 2023-06-28
* **Priority**: High
* **Status**: Not Started

## Description

Create comprehensive documentation for the Web Application Architecture with a focus on user experiences and features. This task involves developing a holistic view of the frontend system that emphasizes how users interact with workflows, tasks, integrations, and analytics, while also documenting the technical architecture that supports these experiences.

## Context

The current UI Rendering Engine documentation contains several TODOs and questions about its scope and responsibilities, mixing frontend component design with rendering logic. A more comprehensive Web Application Architecture documentation is needed that focuses on user experiences and features first, then provides the technical details that support those experiences. This documentation will serve as the foundation for consistent frontend development across the platform.
