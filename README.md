## What is Augmented OS?

Augmented OS is an open-source platform that revolutionises how businesses incorporate AI into their operations. It seamlessly blends AI agents, code execution, and human tasks into unified workflows, allowing you to automate processes that previously required expensive custom development. Instead of piecing together multiple SaaS tools that weren't designed to work together, Augmented OS provides an integrated foundation where AI enhances your existing business processes rather than disrupting them.


**Ideal for:**

* Businesses wanting to harness AI without disrupting existing operations
* Organisations seeking to reduce their growing SaaS subscription costs
* Teams that need customised AI-powered workflows but lack technical resources
* Forward-thinking companies preparing for the AI-augmented future of work
* Developers building intelligent business automation solutions

## Key Benefits

* **Future-Proof Your Business**: Integrate AI capabilities with human workflows without disruption
* **Reduce Cost & Complexity**: Replace multiple SaaS subscriptions with one customisable system
* **Eliminate Repetitive Tasks**: Free your team to focus on high-value work while AI handles the rest
* **Build Without Coding**: Create exactly what you need without hiring expensive developers
* **Scale With Flexibility**: Easily adapt workflows as your business grows and changes
* **Gain Total Visibility**: See exactly how your business is performing with a unified dashboard
* **Maintain Data Control**: Keep your sensitive business data secure on dedicated infrastructure

## How It Works
