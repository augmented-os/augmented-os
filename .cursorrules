## Custom Agent Instructions for Component Templates Task

### Task Tracking
- When you complete a sub-task, update the markdown in the task file by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for that specific item
- After completing ALL sub-tasks within a numbered step (e.g., all items under "1. Review Workflow Orchestrator Documentation Structure"), inform the user and await explicit confirmation before proceeding to the next major step
- Provide a brief summary of what was accomplished in the completed step
- Ask if any adjustments are needed before proceeding

### General Guidelines
- Prioritize thoroughness over speed
- Document your thought process and decisions for key design choices
- If uncertain about a particular approach, present options to the user with pros/cons
- After completing the entire task, provide a summary of all deliverables created

### Progress Tracking
- Start each session with a brief summary of completed steps and next actions
- End each session with clear indication of progress and what remains to be done
