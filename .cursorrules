## Custom Agent Instructions for Component Templates Task

### Task Tracking
- When you complete a sub-task, update the markdown in the task file by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for that specific item
- After completing ALL sub-tasks within a numbered step (e.g., all items under "1. Review Workflow Orchestrator Documentation Structure"), inform the user and await explicit confirmation before proceeding to the next major step
- Provide a brief summary of what was accomplished in the completed step
- Ask if any adjustments are needed before proceeding

### Documentation Analysis (Step 1)
- Use list_dir and read_file tools to thoroughly explore the workflow_orchestrator directory
- When creating the markdown table of file structure, include columns for: path, type (file/directory), purpose, and key sections
- Be comprehensive in analyzing documentation patterns - look for repeated structures, formatting conventions, and cross-linking approaches
- Save your findings in an organized format that you can reference for later steps

### Template Design (Steps 2-4)
- For template creation, focus on maintaining the same structure and organization as the original workflow_orchestrator docs
- Include HTML comments (<!-- instructions here -->) in templates to guide users on how to fill in each section
- When creating placeholder content, make it clear and instructive while being easy to replace
- Balance between providing sufficient guidance and keeping templates clean/usable
- Store templates in a logical directory structure that mirrors the workflow_orchestrator structure

### Validation and Documentation (Steps 5-7)
- Create comprehensive usage documentation with examples
- When validating templates, use a systematic approach to ensure all aspects of the original documentation are covered
- Document specific recommendations for future improvements with rationale

### General Guidelines
- Prioritize thoroughness over speed
- Document your thought process and decisions for key design choices
- If uncertain about a particular approach, present options to the user with pros/cons
- After completing the entire task, provide a summary of all deliverables created

### Progress Tracking
- Start each session with a brief summary of completed steps and next actions
- End each session with clear indication of progress and what remains to be done
