work_steps:
  - step_id: 1
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/__tests__/components/FormField.integration.test.tsx
    instructions: Create comprehensive integration tests for FormField component that test all field types (text, email, date, file, multi-select) with real form scenarios, validation, and state management.
    constraints:
      - Use React Testing Library and vitest
      - Test with actual UI component schemas from database
      - Include accessibility testing with jest-axe
      - Test conditional visibility and validation rules
  - step_id: 2
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/__tests__/components/fields/FieldComponents.integration.test.tsx
    instructions: Create integration tests that verify all field components work correctly with the FormField wrapper, including proper prop passing, error handling, and onChange callbacks.
    constraints:
      - Test each field component in isolation and as part of FormField
      - Verify design token usage and shadcn/ui component integration
      - Test file upload functionality with mock FileList objects
      - Test multi-select behavior with complex option arrays
  - step_id: 3
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/__tests__/state/schemaSlice.integration.test.tsx
    instructions: Create integration tests for the schema slice that verify UI component schema loading, caching, and error handling with the uiComponentService.
    constraints:
      - Mock uiComponentService responses
      - Test React Query integration
      - Verify 5-minute cache TTL behavior
      - Test error states and retry logic
  - step_id: 4
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/__tests__/utils/
    instructions: Create integration tests for utility functions (conditions evaluation, validation) that test real-world scenarios with complex form data and conditional rules.
    constraints:
      - Test edge cases and boundary conditions
      - Include performance testing for large forms
      - Test with various data types (strings, numbers, arrays, files)

self_checklist:
  - "Tests follow established patterns from other feature test suites"
  - "Mock implementations match real service behavior"
  - "All field components have comprehensive integration coverage"
  - "Error scenarios and edge cases are thoroughly tested"
  - "Tests are deterministic and don't rely on external dependencies"
