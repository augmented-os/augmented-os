title: Implement Dynamic UI Interactive Testing Suite
status: todo

work_steps:
  - step_id: 1
    targets:
      - apps/web/.storybook/preview.ts
    instructions: Configure Storybook with @storybook/addon-interactions and @storybook/test for comprehensive interaction testing. Set up global test utilities and ensure proper test environment configuration.
    constraints:
      - Configure @storybook/addon-interactions for user interaction testing
      - Set up @storybook/test utilities for assertions and user events
      - Ensure test environment supports async operations and timers
      - Configure accessibility testing integration
      - Set up proper test data management for consistent test scenarios
  - step_id: 2
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/__stories__/testing/InteractionTests.stories.tsx
    instructions: Replace skeleton content with comprehensive interaction tests covering complete user journeys including form submission workflows, field validation feedback, conditional field visibility, and multi-step form navigation.
    constraints:
      - Use @storybook/test play functions for realistic user interactions
      - Test complete form submission workflows from start to finish
      - Include validation testing with both valid and invalid inputs
      - Test conditional field visibility and dynamic schema changes
      - Include keyboard navigation and accessibility interaction patterns
      - Test error scenarios and recovery workflows
  - step_id: 3
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/__stories__/testing/EdgeCaseTests.stories.tsx
    instructions: Implement edge case testing scenarios including network failures, invalid schemas, large datasets, performance stress testing, and error boundary activation. Focus on production reliability scenarios.
    constraints:
      - Test network failure scenarios and offline behavior
      - Include invalid schema handling and graceful degradation
      - Test performance with large datasets (100+ fields, complex validation)
      - Include schema parsing error scenarios
      - Test memory usage with complex nested forms
      - Include browser compatibility edge cases
