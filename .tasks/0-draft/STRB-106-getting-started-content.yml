work_steps:
  - step_id: 1
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/__stories__/gettingStarted/Introduction.stories.tsx
    instructions: Replace skeleton content with comprehensive introduction explaining what Dynamic UI is, why it exists, and the business value it provides. Include the problem statement (static forms vs database-driven UI), use cases in task management, and clear value proposition.
    constraints:
      - Start with the "why" before explaining the "how"
      - Include embedded live examples of simple vs dynamic forms
      - Reference the task execution use case from architecture docs
      - Keep content accessible to non-technical stakeholders
      - Include clear navigation to next steps
      - Use TSX format with proper Meta configuration for Storybook
  - step_id: 2
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/__stories__/gettingStarted/Architecture.stories.tsx
    instructions: Implement detailed architecture overview explaining the 3-phase development approach, component hierarchy (Atomic → Composite → System), and how schemas drive rendering. Include diagrams and component relationship explanations.
    constraints:
      - Explain the "start simple, build complexity" philosophy
      - Include visual diagrams of component hierarchy from architecture docs
      - Show progression from Phase 1 MVP to Phase 4 optimization
      - Link schema storage (database) to component rendering
      - Include integration points with Redux and API services
      - Use TSX format with proper component examples
  - step_id: 3
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/__stories__/gettingStarted/GettingStarted.stories.tsx
    instructions: Create hands-on getting started guide with step-by-step schema creation examples. Include basic form schema, field types overview, validation setup, and first schema implementation with live preview.
    constraints:
      - Provide copy-paste ready schema examples
      - Include progressive complexity (simple text field → full form)
      - Show immediate visual results for each step
      - Include validation examples and error handling
      - Link to Schema Builder tool for interactive creation
      - Include troubleshooting section for common issues
      - Use TSX format with working component examples
