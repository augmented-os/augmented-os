title: Create Storybook Stories for DynamicUI Field Components
status: todo
priority: medium
assignee: agent
dependencies:
  - STRB-101 # Prerequisite: Storybook infrastructure must be set up
context:
  code:
    - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/components/fields/
    - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/types/schemas.ts
    - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/contexts/DynamicUIStateContext.tsx
work_steps:
  - step_id: 1
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/components/fields/TextInput.stories.tsx
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/components/fields/NumberInput.stories.tsx
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/components/fields/EmailInput.stories.tsx
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/components/fields/TextareaInput.stories.tsx
    instructions: Create comprehensive Storybook stories for basic input field components. Include Default, WithValue, WithError, Disabled, and Required variants. Use proper controls for props like placeholder, label, and validation rules.
    constraints:
      - Follow CSF 3.0 (Component Story Format) with default exports
      - Include proper TypeScript typing for story definitions
      - Use realistic sample data and validation scenarios
  - step_id: 2
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/components/fields/SelectInput.stories.tsx
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/components/fields/MultiSelectInput.stories.tsx
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/components/fields/BooleanInput.stories.tsx
    instructions: Create stories for selection-based field components. Include comprehensive option sets, pre-selected values, and different display modes. Show validation states and interactive behavior.
    constraints:
      - Use realistic option data sets (countries, categories, etc.)
      - Demonstrate all selection states and interactions
      - Include accessibility considerations in documentation
  - step_id: 3
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/components/fields/DateInput.stories.tsx
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/components/fields/FileInput.stories.tsx
    instructions: Create stories for specialized input components. For DateInput, show different date formats and constraints. For FileInput, demonstrate file type restrictions, multiple file selection, and upload progress states.
    constraints:
      - Mock file upload functionality appropriately for Storybook
      - Show realistic validation scenarios for date inputs
      - Include proper error handling demonstrations
  - step_id: 4
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/components/fields/__stories__/FieldStories.utils.ts
    instructions: Create shared utilities for field stories including common props, validation rules, and mock data generators. This will ensure consistency across all field component stories.
    constraints:
      - Export reusable story configurations and mock data
      - Include TypeScript types for story utilities
      - Follow DRY principles to avoid duplication

  manual:
    - description: "All field components render correctly in Storybook with proper controls"
    - description: "Interactive behavior (typing, selecting, etc.) works as expected in stories"
    - description: "Error states and validation scenarios are clearly demonstrated"
    - description: "Stories include helpful documentation and use cases"
    - description: "Accessibility addon shows no violations for field components"
self_checklist:
  - "All field components have comprehensive story coverage"
  - "Stories demonstrate both positive and error scenarios"
  - "Interactive controls allow for easy testing of different props"
  - "Documentation includes proper TypeScript examples"
  - "Shared utilities are properly typed and reusable"
