title: Implement Dynamic UI Visual and Responsive Testing
status: todo
priority: medium
assignee: agent
dependencies:
  - STRB-105 # Skeleton structure must be created first
  - STRB-108 # Interactive testing provides foundation

  code:
    - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/__stories__/testing/

work_steps:
  - step_id: 1
    targets:
      - apps/web/.storybook/main.ts
    instructions: Configure Storybook for visual regression testing with Chromatic integration. Set up viewport configurations, theme variations, and consistent rendering settings for reliable visual diff detection.
    constraints:
      - Configure Chromatic addon for visual regression testing
      - Set up standard viewport sizes (mobile: 375px, tablet: 768px, desktop: 1200px)
      - Configure theme variations (light/dark mode if applicable)
      - Ensure consistent font loading and rendering
      - Set up proper build configurations for visual testing
  - step_id: 2
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/__stories__/testing/VisualTests.stories.tsx
    instructions: Replace skeleton content with comprehensive visual regression test stories covering all component states (loading, error, success), form layouts, display variations, and theme combinations. Focus on capturing visual consistency across updates.
    constraints:
      - Include all major component states for visual comparison
      - Test form layouts with various field combinations
      - Include error states and validation feedback visuals
      - Test loading states and skeleton UI
      - Capture modal and overlay component variations
      - Include accessibility color contrast testing
  - step_id: 3
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/__stories__/testing/ResponsiveTests.stories.tsx
    instructions: Implement responsive design testing stories that validate Dynamic UI components across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints. Include touch interaction patterns and responsive layout adaptations.
    constraints:
      - Test all viewport sizes with realistic content
      - Include touch interaction patterns for mobile devices
      - Test responsive form layouts and field stacking
      - Validate modal and dialog responsive behavior
      - Include orientation change testing (portrait/landscape)
      - Test content overflow and scrolling behavior
