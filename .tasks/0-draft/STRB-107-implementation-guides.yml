    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/__stories__/guides/SchemaGuide.stories.tsx
    instructions: Replace skeleton content with comprehensive schema design guide including complete TypeScript interfaces, field type reference, layout configuration options, and practical design patterns. Include real-world schema examples from simple to complex.
    constraints:
      - Include complete TypeScript interfaces from developer guide
      - Provide copy-paste ready schema examples for common use cases
      - Show both inline and referenced validation patterns
      - Include conditional logic examples (visibleIf usage)
      - Document layout options (sections, columns, spacing)
      - Include schema versioning best practices
      - Use TSX format with proper Meta configuration for Storybook
      - Include working component examples demonstrating schema usage
  - step_id: 2
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/__stories__/guides/ValidationSystem.stories.tsx
    instructions: Create detailed validation system documentation covering both inline validation rules and database-referenced validation rules. Include validation rule types, error handling patterns, and custom validation implementation.
    constraints:
      - Document all supported validation rule types with examples
      - Explain inline vs referenced validation patterns
      - Include cross-field validation examples
      - Show conditional validation based on other field values
      - Document error message customization and internationalization
      - Include performance considerations for complex validation
      - Use TSX format with interactive validation examples
      - Include live validation testing components
  - step_id: 3
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/__stories__/guides/PerformanceGuide.stories.tsx
    instructions: Implement performance guide covering optimization techniques, monitoring metrics, caching strategies, and scalability considerations. Include performance testing examples and troubleshooting guides.
    constraints:
      - Include specific optimization techniques from developer guide
      - Document schema caching strategies and cache invalidation
      - Show performance monitoring and measurement techniques
      - Include guidance on handling large datasets and complex schemas
      - Document memory usage optimization for form rendering
      - Include performance testing examples and benchmarking
      - Use TSX format with performance measurement components
      - Include interactive performance testing tools
