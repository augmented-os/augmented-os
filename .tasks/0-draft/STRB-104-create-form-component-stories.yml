title: Create Storybook Stories for DynamicUI Form and Orchestration Components
status: todo
priority: medium
assignee: agent
dependencies:
  - STRB-101 # Prerequisite: Storybook infrastructure must be set up
  - STRB-102 # Field component stories provide foundation
context:
  code:
    - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/components/DynamicForm.tsx
    - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/components/DynamicUIRenderer.tsx
    - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/components/FormSection.tsx

work_steps:
  - step_id: 1
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/components/FormSection.stories.tsx
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/components/FormActions.stories.tsx
    instructions: Create stories for form structural components. Show FormSection with different field arrangements, validation states, and conditional visibility. Demonstrate FormActions with various button configurations and submission states.
    constraints:
      - Include examples of sections with different field types and layouts
      - Show conditional rendering based on form state
      - Demonstrate validation at section level
      - Include loading and disabled states for actions
  - step_id: 2
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/components/DynamicForm.stories.tsx
    instructions: Create comprehensive stories for the main DynamicForm component. Include examples of simple forms, complex multi-section forms, forms with conditional logic, and forms with various validation scenarios.
    constraints:
      - Use realistic form schemas representing real-world use cases
      - Show complete form lifecycle from empty to submitted states
      - Include examples with async validation and submission
      - Demonstrate error handling and recovery scenarios
  - step_id: 3
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/components/DynamicUIRenderer.stories.tsx
    instructions: Create stories for the top-level orchestration component. Show how it handles both form and display modes, switches between different UI types, and manages complex nested schemas.
    constraints:
      - Include examples that showcase the full range of UI capabilities
      - Show seamless switching between form and display modes
      - Demonstrate error boundary integration
      - Include performance scenarios with large/complex schemas
  - step_id: 4
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/components/DynamicUIErrorBoundary.stories.tsx
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/components/__stories__/FormStories.utils.ts
    instructions: Create stories for error boundary component showing various error scenarios. Also create shared utilities for form component stories including complex schema builders and form state management helpers.
    constraints:
      - Demonstrate different types of rendering errors and recovery
      - Show error boundary with fallback UI
      - Create reusable schema builders for different form patterns
      - Include utilities for simulating async operations and errors
