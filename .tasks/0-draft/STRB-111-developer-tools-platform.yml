work_steps:
  - step_id: 1
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/__stories__/development/SchemaBuilder.stories.tsx
    instructions: Replace skeleton content with comprehensive interactive Schema Builder tool including visual field builder, live preview, drag-and-drop field ordering, validation testing, and export capabilities. This should be a fully functional development tool within Storybook.
    constraints:
      - Create interactive schema builder with live preview functionality
      - Include drag-and-drop field ordering and visual field editor
      - Implement validation rule testing with real-time feedback
      - Add export functionality (TypeScript, JSON, SQL, React component)
      - Include template library with pre-built schema patterns
      - Provide import/export functionality for schema sharing
      - Include performance profiling for complex schemas
  - step_id: 2
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/__stories__/development/DebuggingGuide.stories.tsx
    instructions: Implement comprehensive debugging tools and troubleshooting guide including schema validation utilities, performance profilers, render debugging tools, and common issue resolution guides.
    constraints:
      - Create schema validation and linting tools
      - Include performance profiling and bottleneck identification
      - Add render debugging tools for complex conditional logic
      - Include validation rule testing and debugging utilities
      - Create troubleshooting guide for common schema issues
      - Add logging and debugging utilities for production troubleshooting
  - step_id: 3
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/__stories__/development/MigrationPatterns.stories.tsx
    instructions: Create schema migration and evolution tools including versioning strategies, backward compatibility testing, migration utilities, and rollback procedures. Include tools for testing schema changes before deployment.
    constraints:
      - Document schema versioning and migration strategies
      - Create tools for testing schema compatibility
      - Include migration utilities for schema evolution
      - Add rollback and recovery procedures
      - Create tools for testing schema changes in isolation
      - Include guidelines for breaking vs non-breaking changes
