title: Implement Real-Time Status Updates
status: todo
priority: low
dependencies:
  - INTG-102 # Integration list components must be implemented first
  - INTG-103 # Integration detail view must be implemented first
context:
  code:
    - src/features/integrationsHub/types/index.ts
    - src/features/integrationsHub/components/StatusIndicator.tsx
    - src/integrations/supabase/index.ts
work_steps:
  - step_id: 1
    targets:
      - src/features/integrationsHub/hooks/use-real-time-status.ts
    instructions: Create a hook that subscribes to real-time updates for integration instance statuses using WebSockets or a similar technology.
    constraints:
      - Include connection management for WebSocket
      - Handle reconnection on failures
      - Optimize for minimal data transfer
  
  - step_id: 2
    targets:
      - src/features/integrationsHub/components/StatusIndicator.tsx
    instructions: Update the StatusIndicator component to support real-time status transitions with appropriate animations.
    constraints:
      - Add smooth transition animations between states
      - Include pulsing or other visual cues for active updating
      - Maintain accessibility during animations
  
  - step_id: 3
    targets:
      - src/features/integrationsHub/components/IntegrationsList.tsx
    instructions: Enhance the IntegrationsList component to refresh data and update status indicators in real-time.
    constraints:
      - Minimize full re-renders during updates
      - Maintain sort order and filter settings during updates
      - Include visual indication of recently updated items
  
  - step_id: 4
    targets:
      - src/features/integrationsHub/components/detail/IntegrationDetailView.tsx
    instructions: Update the detail view to show real-time updates for the current integration instance.
    constraints:
      - Display timestamp of last status update
      - Show visual indication when data is being refreshed
      - Allow manual refresh option

  manual:
    - description: Verify that status updates appear in real-time without page refresh
    - description: Check that animations are smooth and not distracting
    - description: Ensure the system recovers from connection interruptions
    - description: Verify performance remains good with many integrations

self_checklist:
  - WebSocket or similar connection is properly managed
  - Status transitions are visually smooth
  - List maintains proper sorting/filtering during updates
  - Real-time updates don't cause performance issues
  - User is aware of when data was last updated
