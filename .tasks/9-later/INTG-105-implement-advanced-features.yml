title: Implement Advanced Filtering and Accessibility Features
status: todo
priority: low
dependencies:
  - INTG-102 # Integration list components must be implemented
  - INTG-103 # Integration detail view must be implemented
context:
  code:
    - src/features/integrationsHub/components/SearchAndFilter.tsx
    - src/features/integrationsHub/hooks/use-integration-filters.ts
    - src/features/workflowDesigner/components/WorkflowHeader.tsx
work_steps:
  - step_id: 1
    targets:
      - src/features/integrationsHub/components/filters/AdvancedFilterPanel.tsx
    instructions: Create an advanced filter panel that allows filtering by multiple criteria including system type, status, usage, last updated, etc.
    constraints:
      - Use existing UI components for inputs where possible
      - Support saving filter presets
      - Ensure mobile-friendly design
  
  - step_id: 2
    targets:
      - src/features/integrationsHub/hooks/use-advanced-filters.ts
    instructions: Implement a hook to manage advanced filter state and logic, including filter combinations and persistence.
    constraints:
      - Support URL parameter synchronization for filters
      - Include proper TypeScript typing for filter options
      - Optimize filter performance for large lists
  
  - step_id: 3
    targets:
      - src/features/integrationsHub/components/IntegrationsList.tsx
      - src/features/integrationsHub/components/IntegrationCard.tsx
      - src/features/integrationsHub/components/detail/IntegrationDetailView.tsx
    instructions: Enhance existing components with accessibility features including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and high contrast mode.
    constraints:
      - Follow WAI-ARIA guidelines
      - Include focused states for keyboard navigation
      - Add appropriate aria attributes
      - Ensure color is not the only indicator for status
  
  - step_id: 4
    targets:
      - src/features/integrationsHub/components/visualization/StatusTimeline.tsx
    instructions: Implement a timeline visualization component to show historical status changes for integration instances.
    constraints:
      - Ensure timeline is accessible
      - Include interactive elements for exploring timeline events
      - Support different time ranges

  manual:
    - description: Verify that advanced filtering works for all supported criteria
    - description: Check keyboard navigation through all components
    - description: Test with screen reader to ensure all information is accessible
    - description: Verify that status timeline shows accurate historical data
    - description: Test filter persistence across page navigations

self_checklist:
  - All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
  - Status indicators have text alternatives
  - Advanced filters work correctly for all criteria
  - Filter state is preserved in URL parameters
  - Timeline visualization is accessible and interactive
  - Focus states are clearly visible for keyboard navigation
