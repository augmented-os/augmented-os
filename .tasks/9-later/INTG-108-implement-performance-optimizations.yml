title: Implement Performance Optimizations
status: todo
priority: medium
dependencies:
  - INTG-102 # Integration list components must be implemented first
  - INTG-103 # Integration detail view must be implemented first
context:
  code:
    - src/features/integrationsHub/components/IntegrationsList.tsx
    - src/features/integrationsHub/hooks/use-integration-instances.ts
    - src/features/integrationsHub/components/detail/IntegrationDetailView.tsx
work_steps:
  - step_id: 1
    targets:
      - src/features/integrationsHub/hooks/use-integration-instances.ts
    instructions: Enhance the data fetching hook with pagination, caching, and optimized queries to improve performance with large datasets.
    constraints:
      - Implement efficient pagination strategy
      - Add data caching with appropriate invalidation
      - Optimize query structure for minimal data transfer
  
  - step_id: 2
    targets:
      - src/features/integrationsHub/components/IntegrationsList.tsx
      - src/features/integrationsHub/components/IntegrationCard.tsx
    instructions: Optimize list rendering with virtualization or windowing techniques to efficiently handle large numbers of integration instances.
    constraints:
      - Use windowing library (e.g., react-window) for efficient list rendering
      - Implement lazy loading of card content
      - Include smooth scrolling behavior
  
  - step_id: 3
    targets:
      - src/features/integrationsHub/components/visualization/HealthMetricsSection.tsx
      - src/features/integrationsHub/components/visualization/UsageStatisticsSection.tsx
    instructions: Optimize chart and visualization components to minimize performance impact and ensure smooth interactions.
    constraints:
      - Lazy load visualization libraries
      - Use memoization for expensive calculations
      - Implement progressive loading for complex visualizations
  
  - step_id: 4
    targets:
      - src/features/integrationsHub/utils/performance-utils.ts
    instructions: Create utility functions for performance monitoring, optimization, and diagnostics to identify and address bottlenecks.
    constraints:
      - Add performance measurement utilities
      - Implement debug mode for performance metrics
      - Create helper functions for common optimization patterns

    - description: Check that pagination and infinite scrolling work correctly
    - description: Ensure visualizations render and update efficiently
    - description: Verify overall application responsiveness meets requirements

self_checklist:
  - Pagination or virtualization is implemented for lists
  - Appropriate caching strategies are in place
  - Network requests are batched and optimized
  - Expensive calculations are memoized
  - Large dependencies are loaded lazily when possible
  - Performance remains acceptable with large datasets
