title: Implement Bulk Action Capabilities
status: todo
priority: low
dependencies:
  - INTG-102 # Integration list components must be implemented first
context:
  code:
    - src/features/integrationsHub/components/IntegrationsList.tsx
    - src/features/integrationsHub/types/index.ts
    - src/components/ui/button.tsx
    - src/components/ui/dialog.tsx
work_steps:
  - step_id: 1
    targets:
      - src/features/integrationsHub/types/index.ts
    instructions: Update the types to include selection state and bulk action definitions.
    constraints:
      - Define types for selection state (none, some, all)
      - Define available bulk actions with type safety
      - Include types for action results and errors
  
  - step_id: 2
    targets:
      - src/features/integrationsHub/hooks/use-selection.ts
    instructions: Create a hook to manage selection state for integration instances, supporting individual and bulk selection.
    constraints:
      - Support selecting all, none, and individual items
      - Track partial selection state
      - Include helper methods for common selection operations
  
  - step_id: 3
    targets:
      - src/features/integrationsHub/components/SelectionControls.tsx
    instructions: Implement selection controls including checkboxes, select all, and bulk action buttons.
    constraints:
      - Follow accessibility guidelines for selection controls
      - Show appropriate state for partial selection
      - Include clear visual indication of selected items
  
  - step_id: 4
    targets:
      - src/features/integrationsHub/components/BulkActionBar.tsx
    instructions: Create a component that appears when items are selected, showing available bulk actions and selection count.
    constraints:
      - Display actions contextually based on selection
      - Include confirmation for destructive actions
      - Show progress during action execution
  
  - step_id: 5
    targets:
      - src/features/integrationsHub/utils/bulk-action-utils.ts
    instructions: Implement utility functions to execute bulk actions on selected integration instances.
    constraints:
      - Support parallel execution where appropriate
      - Include proper error handling for partial failures
      - Provide progress updates during execution

  automated:
    - command: npm run lint
      description: Pass ESLint rules
    - command: npm run typecheck
      description: Compile without TypeScript errors
    - command: npm run build
      description: Vite production build succeeds
  manual:
    - description: Verify that selection controls work for individual and all items
    - description: Check that bulk action bar appears correctly when items are selected
    - description: Ensure bulk actions execute properly with visual feedback
    - description: Verify that error handling works for failed bulk actions

self_checklist:
  - Selection state is clearly indicated visually
  - Bulk action controls are intuitive and accessible
  - Confirmations are provided for destructive actions
  - Progress indicators show status during bulk operations
  - Error handling gracefully manages partial failures
