    instructions: Implement a React hook to manage connection test state, execution, and results.
    constraints:
      - Handle loading, success, and error states
      - Include retry functionality
      - Support test history tracking
  
  - step_id: 3
    targets:
      - src/features/integrationsHub/components/detail/TestConnectionButton.tsx
    instructions: Create a button component for initiating connection tests with appropriate loading states and result feedback.
    constraints:
      - Show clear loading indicator during test
      - Display test results in a user-friendly way
      - Include retry option for failed tests
  
  - step_id: 4
    targets:
      - src/features/integrationsHub/components/detail/TestResultsDisplay.tsx
    instructions: Implement a component to display connection test results, including details for both successful and failed tests.
