  - step_id: 1
    targets:
      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/__stories__/
    instructions: Create the complete directory structure for the new Dynamic UI documentation organization, ensuring all folders exist and are properly organized for the 6-section layout.
    constraints:
      - Create __stories__ directory at dynamicUI root level
      - Set up subdirectories: gettingStarted/, guides/, examples/, testing/, development/
      - Follow the naming conventions from the architecture docs

    instructions: Create skeleton MDX files for the Getting Started section with proper titles, navigation order, and placeholder content that explains what each section will contain. Include basic structure and navigation to show the intended flow.
    constraints:
      - Use proper Storybook meta configuration for MDX
      - Set correct story titles for navigation hierarchy
      - Include brief descriptions of what each section will cover
      - Add placeholders for key sections (with TODO comments)
      - Ensure files load without errors in Storybook

      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/__stories__/guides/PerformanceGuide.stories.mdx
    instructions: Create skeleton implementation guide MDX files with proper structure, headings, and placeholder content. Include TypeScript interface placeholders and example code blocks to show the intended content structure.
    constraints:
      - Include proper MDX meta with titles and descriptions
      - Add main section headings with TODO placeholders
      - Include empty code blocks with comments about intended content
      - Reference the developer guide documentation in placeholders
      - Ensure proper navigation order within the Guides section

      - apps/web/src/features/dynamicUI/__stories__/examples/AdvancedPatterns.stories.tsx
    instructions: Create skeleton story files for business examples with basic story structure, placeholder schemas, and TODO comments indicating the intended content. Set up the story configuration and basic component renders.
    constraints:
      - Use proper Storybook CSF3 format for story files
      - Include placeholder schemas with TODO comments
      - Set up basic story exports with descriptive names
      - Add meta configuration with proper titles and descriptions

  - step_id: 7
    targets:
      - apps/web/.storybook/main.ts
      - apps/web/.storybook/preview.ts
    instructions: Update Storybook configuration to properly support the new MDX documentation and testing features. Ensure all addons are configured and the story loading patterns include the new __stories__ directory.
    constraints:
      - Add support for MDX files in the new directory structure
