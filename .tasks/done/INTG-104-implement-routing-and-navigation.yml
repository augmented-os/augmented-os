status: todo
priority: medium
dependencies:
  - INTG-101 # Basic structure must be implemented first
  - INTG-102 # Integration list components must be implemented
context:
  code:
    - src/routes.config.tsx
    - src/pages/WorkflowsPage.tsx
    - src/components/layout/Layout.tsx
    - src/components/navigation/Sidebar.tsx
work_steps:
  - step_id: 1
    targets:

      - Ensure routes are nested under the main layout
      - Include proper route parameters for integration ID in detail view
  
  - step_id: 2
    targets:
      - src/pages/IntegrationsHubPage.tsx
    instructions: Implement the main page component that handles routing between list and detail views based on URL parameters.
