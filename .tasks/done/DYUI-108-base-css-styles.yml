    instructions: |
      Implement dynamic UI components using Tailwind CSS utilities and existing design system.
      Use shadcn/ui components where applicable and leverage existing CSS custom properties.
      Focus on utility-first approach with conditional classes using cn() utility.
    constraints:
      - Use Tailwind utility classes instead of custom CSS classes
      - Leverage existing CSS custom properties from src/index.css
      - Use shadcn/ui components (Button, Input, Label, etc.) where applicable
      - Use cn() utility from tailwind-merge for conditional styling
      - Support responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints
      - Use existing color system: bg-primary, text-foreground, border-border, etc.
      - Implement form layouts using Tailwind grid and flexbox utilities
      - Use existing spacing scale: p-4, m-6, gap-4, etc.
      - Support focus states with focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary
      - Error states using text-destructive, border-destructive
      - Form sections using existing border and background utilities

    instructions: |
      Create utility functions for component styling variants using class-variance-authority.
      Define reusable styling patterns for form components.
    constraints:
      - Use class-variance-authority (cva) for component variants
      - Create variants for spacing: compact, normal, spacious
      - Create variants for form field states: default, error, disabled
      - Create variants for button styles using existing design tokens
      - Export styling utilities for consistent component styling
